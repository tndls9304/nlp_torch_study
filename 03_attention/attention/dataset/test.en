Italian astronomers have found signs of water, a necessary ingredient for life, in the atmosphere of planets orbiting distant stars.
Having water does not mean other planets will be teeming with life but if the discovery is confirmed it will fuel speculation that it could be possible.
They used a 32-meter radio telescope to search for water maser emissions, which could indicate water in a planet's atmosphere when it is bathed in the infrared light of its star.

The agency urged nations to prepare for the possibility of such strikes.

The West is right to seek vengeance and justice for the thousands killed on Sept.
Target the guilty and their allies.
Just as importantly, we need to demonstrate with our restraint that we do not hold innocents accountable for the cruelties of history or the actions of fanatics.
“An eye for an eye,” in this case, is a prescription for blindness.
11 atrocities is smoked out of the caves of Afghanistan, the war will not be won.
The fanatical groups exist in the vacuum of Middle Eastern politics, nurtured by the rot of its illegitimate dictatorships and the heretical extremism of its mullahs and clerics.
Islam is not to blame for this, but neither is it innocent.
As Edmund Burke said, “All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.”
The West cannot fight this battle, for obvious reasons.
But the West cannot do what is needed:
It will always be seen as the invader, as latter-day Crusaders.
There are few signs that Islam is ready for such a struggle.
Remember, as religions go, this one is still young.
That is only 1,379 years ago.
By comparison, Christian Europe in the year 1379 was just finished with the Crusades and mired in its Dark Ages.
Ahead still was the horror of the Inquisition, the Reformation and all of its religious fanaticism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, along with revolution and imperialism and then the mechanized murder of Naziism, Communism and Hiroshima.
Of course, the analogy between civilizations is deeply flawed.
in the best-case scenario, Islamic civilization will learn from the mistakes of the West.
Admittedly, there is not a great deal of evidence to support this hope right now.
“Secular” Muslim states exist, but usually uncomfortably and as the result of Western meddling or the colonial period.
Much of the Islamic world looks down on these states as lackeys of the West:

You could look at these “moderate” Islamic states, plus Egypt and Saudi Arabia and now Pakistan, and conclude that there are “moderates” in the region who will help win the longer, harder struggle to exorcise Islam’s own demons.
The problem here is obvious:
The Mubaraks and King Fahds and Gen. Musharrafs of the world are hardly representative of their populations.
Instead, they represent a small elite in each place that has a common interest with the West in “stability.”
So, in exchange for stability, the West has helped keep them in power.
Without the West, they would all fall, and as long as the West keeps them in power, it invites the rage of those abused by these regimes.
Still, stability is the ideal of rich societies.
To the western world, stability in the Middle East means cheap oil and, many assumed before Sept. 11, a quarantine of the worst forms of terror inside the region.
For the regimes running these nations, stability translates directly to wealth, power and survival.
But what does it mean to an Egyptian fisherman or a Pakistani stall trader who can't feed his family?
Stability in this case means misery, endless misery in the service of a corrupt regime supported by the far-off giant, America.
Has your child ever died of a treatable disease for lack of medicine?
Have the police ever arrested you and run 240 volts up your genitals for complaining about the government?
Is it any wonder, then, that the vast millions succumb to the heresies of Islamic extremists, who twist the Koran into a call for blood that promises a better world for Muslims who obey?
So now we wage war on terrorism, and so we should.
Only the Muslim world has the power to wage war against its own demons.
The might of the West will garner respect in the Muslim world if those responsible are dealt with swiftly.
In the longer run, however, new bin Ladens will rise to replace them if the West goes on propping up repressive Arab dictatorships.
The United States now must demand far more than that cheap oil for its friendship.
To do less would merely satisfy our need for revenge but would doom our children to a new Dark Age.

Not surprisingly, many people throughout the country are experiencing depression, fear and sleeplessness after witnessing on television or firsthand the horrific attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.
But others say that many people prone to depression are depressed now by the events.
Indeed, some experts say that many people are turning to food, shopping, movies and sex as a means of escaping and coping with fear and sadness.
Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociologist, said there are many reasons people have sex during crises.
Schwartz predicted a "baby boomlet" would follow nine months after the attacks but one not nearly as big as the baby boom that followed the end of World War Two.
North Korea has revealed to the United States that it has a secret and active nuclear weapons program, only after Pyongyang was confronted with evidence that it has enough plutonium for at least two nuclear weapons, One of the officials told Reuters that North Korea's activities "have effectively nullified the 1994 Agreed Framework," an agreement under which Pyongyang promised to freeze its nuclear program.

Serge Brammertz, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, congratulated Serbian authorities for taking Karadzic into custody and called it "an important day for the victims.
"It is also an important day for international justice, because it clearly demonstrates that nobody is beyond the reach of the law and that sooner or later all fugitives will be brought to justice," Brammertz said.
He said authorities "in due course" will determine when Karadzic is to be transferred to the tribunal at The Hague.
His arrest leaves former Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, as the top-ranking war crimes suspect still at large.
Former U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke blamed Karadzic for the 300,000 deaths in Bosnia, the bloodiest of the Balkan wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (CNN) One of five feet that have mysteriously washed up on the shores of British Columbia over the past year has been linked to a depressed man who disappeared a year ago, police said Saturday.
Sgt. Pierre Lemaitre said DNA testing helped identify the man.
The man's name was not made public at the family's request, he said.
The foot is the first to be identified by investigators, who have been working on the bizarre case since August, when two feet were found days apart about 40 miles southwest of Vancouver on islands in the Strait of Georgia.
The first foot was discovered by beachcombers on Jedidiah Island. Days later, a right foot was found inside a man's size-12 Reebok sneaker on Gabriola Island.
Two weeks ago, police said that a foot found on Valdez Island on February 8 and another foot found June 16 on Westham Island, more than 25 miles away and across a strait, belong to the same man.
Another foot was found May 22 on Kirkland Island in the Fraser River. It was laced inside a New Balance running shoe and is the only one belonging to a woman, authorities said.
A sixth discovery last month turned out to be a hoax, an animal paw stuffed inside a shoe.
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) Brenda Walsh is all grown-up and returning to Beverly Hills, 90210, this fall.
But cast members of the new CW spin-off, "90210," are speculating whether Shannen Doherty will be equally mature when she reprises her role as Walsh.
"I have heard some of the stories," "90210" star AnnaLynne McCord said of the sometimes-volatile relationship between Doherty and co-star Jennie Garth on the original series, which aired from 1990-2000.
Garth is returning to her role as Kelly Taylor, now a school guidance counselor, on "90210.
In the new series, Doherty's Walsh is now a famous theater director invited back to West Beverly Hills High School to stage a musical, CW announced Saturday at a Television Critics Association meeting in, of course, Beverly Hills.
Her guest role plays out over multiple episodes, the network said.
"If she and Jennie have it out while I'm there, OK, then, all right, so that's the story," McCord said of any possible discord during production.
"We're co-workers, we're going to be co-stars and I want to treat her (Doherty) with the respect that I would treat any other co-star," said McCord

Manchester United have told Cristiano Ronaldo there will be no new contract with a pay rise to match any offer from Real Madrid and that he must start displaying "commitment and loyalty.
But Ronaldo has again refused to commit his future to United, having spent the summer making no secret of his desire to move to Spain.
United chief executive David Gill believes that could have been a tactic to command a higher salary at Old Trafford.
Such was United's anger at Madrid's pursuit of Ronaldo that manager Sir Alex Ferguson made an unsuccessful complaint to FIFA while his Portuguese winger was at the Euro 2008 finals.
Before taking United on a tour of South Africa, Ferguson flew to Portugal last week to meet with Ronaldo for the first time since the aftermath of May's Champions League triumph.
It prompted the Scot to state his confidence that Ronaldo would stay, but the player continued to fuel talk of a transfer while vacationing in California.
"I don't know about the future, only God knows it.
I can't say any more.
(CNN) A U.S. Air Force B-52 with six crew members on board crashed off the island of Guam on Monday, an Air Force spokesman said.
Rescuers with the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy were searching a point in the Pacific Ocean about 30 miles northwest of Guam, a U.S. territory, where the plane is believed to have crashed, said Capt. Joel Stark, spokesman for Andersen Air Force Base.
He had no information on whether anyone survived.
The B-52H Stratofortress was based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, and was in Guam as part of a four-month rotation, Stark said.
It went down about 9:45 a.m. local time (7: 45 p.m. ET Sunday).
A B-52 from Andersen Air Force Base was scheduled to fly over crowds celebrating Liberation Day, which commemorates the U.S. capture of Guam from Japan in 1944, Stark said.
But it was unclear whether the plane that crashed was the one that had been scheduled to perform the flyover.
BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) Presumptive U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama arrived in Iraq on Monday for talks with Iraqi officials and American military commanders in a 5-year-old war he has pledged to end, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
The trip to Iraq is Obama's second after a visit in 2006 and follows a Saturday stop in Afghanistan, part of a closely watched overseas trip for the Illinois senator that will include other stops in the Middle East in Europe.
Obama has said that if elected, he would order the military to end the war in Iraq and commit more troops to Afghanistan.
Accompanying Obama is Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee and an outspoken critic of the Iraq war.
"The senators have a busy day ahead of them, as they meet with senior Iraqi officials, coalition leadership and officials from the U.S. Embassy," Embassy spokesman Armand Cucciniello said.
They also plan to meet with troops from their home states and U.S. civilians working in Iraq, Cucciniello said.

Three Germans kidnapped by Kurdish rebels in Turkey were released Sunday after more than a week in captivity.
The men are recovering at the German Embassy in the Turkish capital, Ankara, according to Germany's foreign minister.
"According to the circumstances they are doing well," German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Sunday in Berlin. "And of course we share the happiness with the freed men and with their relatives.
It is unclear what prompted the rebels to release the hostages.
They had said they would hold them until the German government stops "its enemy-like politics" against them.
Mehmet Cetin, the governor of the city of Agri in Turkey, said that after officials check the health of the released hostages, they will be returned to Germany.
The Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, confirmed taking the three Germans Helmut Johann, Martin Georpe and Lars Holper Reime from Mount Agri on July 9, according to the Firat News Agency, a pro-Kurdish Web site.
"We are not the enemies of the German people, and we have not mistreated any of the hostages," the PKK said, according to Firat. "Unless the German government announces it has stopped its enemy-like politics towards PKK and the Kurds, we will not release the German citizens.
Soon after, Steinmeier issued a statement saying the government refuses to be "blackmailed.
(CNN) Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday offered his strongest public statement yet on sex abuse against minors by Roman Catholic priests, apologizing to victims and calling the abuse "evil.
The apology came during a mass in Sydney, Australia, and expands on comments the pope made during an April visit to the United States, during which he publicly acknowledged the pain the church's sex abuse scandal has caused and met privately with abuse victims.
"Indeed, I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured and I assure them as their pastor that I too share in their suffering," he said Saturday at Sydney's St. Mary's Cathedral.
The comments came on the pope's third day of public appearances in Australia, where he is attending World Youth Day.
Dubbed "the Catholic Woodstock," the event is believed to be the largest Christian gathering in the world and this year is believed to have attracted more
The pope said he wanted to "acknowledge the shame which we have all felt" over reports of sex abuse by clergy and said those responsible for the "evils" should be brought to justice.
He asked those attending the mass to help their bishops to end the abuse.
"It is an urgent priority to create a safer, more wholesome environment, especially for young people," he said.
In April, the 81-year-old pontiff acknowledged "the enormous pain" caused by sexual abuse of children by the
"It is vitally important that the vulnerable are always shielded from souls who would cause harm," he said then.
Benedict also met with three people who said they were childhood victims of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy.
PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (CNN) A Pennsylvania woman has been charged in the slaying of an 18-year-old woman who was found with her uterus cut open and her fetus removed, authorities said Sunday.
Andrea Curry-Demus, 38, of Wilkinsburg was charged Sunday with criminal homicide kidnapping and unlawful restraint in connection with last week's death of Kia Johnson, Allegheny County police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said.
Police found Johnson's body in Curry-Demus' apartment Friday, two days after Curry-Demus arrived at a hospital with a newborn and falsely claimed that the baby was hers, authorities said.
Police have not confirmed whether the infant belonged to Johnson, whose family reported her missing last week.
Johnson's eviscerated body which police said they found after receiving calls about a foul odor coming from the apartment "was in a state of moderate decomposition," and she had been dead about two days, Medical Examiner Karl Williams said.
The woman's hands and feet were bound by duct tape, police said.
A placenta was found at the scene, Williams told reporters.
Authorities said they used dental records to confirm Johnson's identity.
Drugs were found at the apartment, and authorities are awaiting toxicology results to determine whether she was sedated, Williams said.
It's unclear whether Johnson was alive when her infant was taken, he added.
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) &#8212; Cambodia has sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council to call attention to its continuing standoff with Thailand over an ancient border temple on disputed land.
The country is not asking for U.N. intervention, said Information Minister Kheu Kanharith.
Rather, the letter that Cambodia's permanent mission in New York submitted to the chairmen of the Security Council and the General Assembly is meant to draw attention to a crisis that entered its sixth day Sunday.
The two countries agreed to meet Monday to defuse tensions even as each side continued to amass more troops to the site of the Preah Vihear temple.
Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side.
Thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia that places both the temple and the surrounding area in that country's territory.
Earlier this month, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site places the U.N. says have outstanding universal value.
The decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple.
Opposition parties in Thailand used the issue to attack the government, which initially backed the heritage listing.
A Thai court overturned the pact, prompting the resignation of Thailand's foreign minister, Noppadon Pattama.
He had endorsed the application.
BETHLEHEM (CNN) British Prime Minister Gordon Brown demanded Sunday that Israel cease settlement construction and promised more money to jump-start the battered Palestinian economy.
In his first trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories as Britain's leader, Brown repeatedly stressed that economics are key to Mideast peace and said Israel should ease travel restrictions in the West Bank that have hindered commerce.
But his strongest comments were reserved for the settlements:
"I think the whole European Union is very clear on this matter: We want to see a freeze on settlements.
it makes the compromises Israel needs to make for peace more difficult," Brown said at a news conference with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
Abbas went further in his criticism of Israel's construction in disputed east Jerusalem and the adjacent West Bank, telling Brown that Israel lacks commitment to the "principles and spirit" of Mideast peace efforts.
He singled out stepped-up construction of homes for Jews in areas of Jerusalem the Palestinians claim for their capital.
At a joint appearance after meeting Brown later in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert acknowledged that Israel disagrees with the Palestinians and Britain over the issue of settlements but added, "I am absolutely convinced, Mr. Prime Minister, that this should not stand in the way of an agreement between us and the Palestinians.
Olmert repeated his contention that agreement is "closer than ever" and said he hoped for an accord by the end of the year.
Beijing started its drastic traffic control plan Sunday in a last-minute push to clear the capital's pollution-choked skies in time for the August Olympics.
Skies were relatively clear Sunday, and traffic was light.
But the real test will come when the work week begins.
Two new subway lines and an airport rail link should also bring relief. All three lines opened Saturday, a month behind schedule.
It is unclear how the effectiveness of the plan will be gauged.
The government has not made public a specific target for emissions levels or said how it will measure air quality.
"Pea-soup air at the opening ceremony would be their worst nightmare," said Victor Cha, director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University.
Taiwanese officials say flash floods triggered by tropical storm Kalmaegi have killed 19 people in Taiwan.
The disaster relief center lists another six people as missing in its Sunday report.
The storm lashed southern Taiwan with torrential rains Friday, triggering flash floods and landslides.
The death toll was raised from 13 to 19.
The center says mudslides buried two houses that killed seven people in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
Typhoons and tropical storms often hit the island between July and September.
Kalmaegi, the Korean word for sea gull, was the first storm to hit Taiwan this year.
KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) Sen. Barack Obama said Sunday that United States needs to focus on Afghanistan in its battle against terrorism.
But we have to understand that the situation is precarious and urgent here in Afghanistan. And I believe this has to be our central focus, the central front, on our battle against terrorism," Obama said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation.
Obama said troop levels must increase in Afghanistan.
"For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three," he told CBS. "I think it's very important that we unify command more effectively to coordinate our military activities. But military alone is not going to be enough.
Obama met Sunday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, a leader the Democratic senator has criticized for not doing enough to rebuild the war-torn nation.
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee met with Karzai in Kabul, the capital city, during Obama's first visit to the Asian nation.
Karzai's spokesman characterized the senator's message as pleasant.
They reassured the support of U.S. people to Afghanistan," Humayoon Hamidzada said.
Karzai met with the congressional delegation that includes Obama, and they discussed the achievements of the Afghan government as well as challenges such as terrorism, corruption and illegal drugs.

Jesters come from the devil.
You won't have any trouble believing that aphorism when you see Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker in "The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan's hotly anticipated and often brilliantly executed follow-up to "Batman Begins.
His face caked in cracked white greasepaint, his smile a grotesque red lipstick scar, kohl rimming his eyes, the Joker is a cruel kind of clown, the kind that is only interested in the last laugh.
Ledger dominates this movie as a living presence, a live wire, dangerous and unpredictable.
Even more than Batman himself, the Joker would usually scream "camp" (and has in the TV series and other movies) but Nolan refuses to go there.
His Gotham is cement and glass, a "real" city not so different from what we might find in any contemporary action thriller. (Chicago doubles for Batman's metropolis.)
Unlike Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher, who directed previous Batman films, Nolan favors location work over studio artifice, and he seems determined to keep the computer-generated imagery within the bounds of gravity.
In "The Dark Knight" (Nolan must have been tempted to add "of the Soul" to the title), the Joker might be his shadow or his evil twin.
In some sick way, they need each other.
"You complete me," the Joker lisps to Batman, mimicking (mocking?) "Jerry Maguire."
The word is nowhere stated, but this Joker is unmistakably a terrorist he blows up hospitals, rigs bombs to commuter ferries, burns his own ill-gotten gains. That makes Batman a kind of one-man Department of Homeland Security.
However, the only legitimate alternative turns out to be a civic crusader, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).
That's the movie's ultimate ideological battleground.
Unfortunately, if Dent gives the movie a classic character arc, Eckhart's disappointingly bland performance fails to nail the narcissism that must be the flip side to his zeal, making his ultimate about-face hard to accept.
Whenever the Joker and Batman are in the vicinity, the movie hums with finely tuned dread and anticipation.
But the longer it goes on (and yes, it does go on too long), Dent triangulates the equation, ultimately pulling it out of whack.
In a summer when action overwhelms intelligence (and even good sense), here's a movie that works on many levels.
It even features the single most awesome truck stunt I've ever seen.
And though Ledger's tragic death in January can't help but cast a morbid pall over the proceedings and that's saying something, given some of the film's plot points when he's on the screen the movie lights up.
A group of experts from around the world will hold a first of its kind conference Thursday on global catastrophic risks.
They will discuss what should be done to prevent these risks from becoming realities that could lead to the end of human life on Earth as we know it.
Speakers at the four-day event at Oxford University in Britain will talk about topics including nuclear terrorism and what to do if a large asteroid were to be on a collision course with our planet.
On the final day of the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference, experts will focus on what could be the unintended consequences of new technologies, such as superintelligent machines that, if ill-conceived, might cause the demise of Homo sapiens.
than human beings would also be very powerful," said Dr. Nick Bostrom, director of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, host of the symposium. "If we get something wrong, you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species.
Bostrom is a philosopher and a leading thinker of transhumanism, a movement that advocates not only the study of the potential threats and promises that future technologies could pose to human life but also the ways in which emergent technologies could be used to make the very act of living better.
"We want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that," Bostrom said.
"We will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well," Bostrom said.
"The changes will be faster and more profound than the very, very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution.
Bostrom declined to predict an exact time frame when this revolutionary biotechnological metamorphosis might occur. "Maybe it will take eight years or 200 years," he said. "It is very hard to predict.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called President Bush "a total failure" on Thursday, among the California Democrat's harshest assessments to date of the president.
God bless him, bless his heart, president of the United States a total failure, losing all credibility with the American people on the economy, on the war, on energy, you name the subject," Pelosi told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in an exclusive interview.
At the White House on Wednesday, Bush noted that there were only 26 legislative days left in the fiscal year and said Congress would need to pass a spending bill every other day to "get their fundamental job done.
"This is not a record to be proud of, and I think the American people deserve better," Bush said.
In the interview, Pelosi said the president was in no position to criticize Congress and brushed aside the criticisms as "something to talk about because he has no ideas.
But Pelosi's comments come as a new Gallup poll registers the lowest level of congressional approval among Americans in the polling organization's 30-year history of conducting that survey.
That poll showed that its approval rating had reached an anemic 14 percent, while more than 70 percent of those polled said they disapproved of the job Congress is doing.
Just over a year after Apple birthed the first iPhone, the long-awaited, next-generation iPhone 3G has arrived bearing a mildly tweaked design and a load of new features.
With access to a faster 3G wireless network, Microsoft Exchange server e-mail, and support for a staggering array of third-party software from the iPhone App Store, the new handset is the iPhone we've been waiting for.
It still lacks some basic features but when compared with what the original model was year ago, this device sets a new benchmark for the cell phone world.
With the iPhone 3G, Apple appears to have fixed some call-quality performance issues we had with the previous model in our initial tests, the volume is louder with less background buzz than before.
Music and video quality were largely unchanged, but we didn't have many complaints in that department to begin with.
We're worried about battery life some early reviews indicate that the iPhone 3G lasts only a day but we'll run full tests over the next couple of days and report our results on this page.
Price may well remain our largest concern.
New AT&T customers and most current AT&T customers can buy the iPhone 3G for $199 for the 8GB model and $299 for the 16GB model.
Either way, you'll pay $15 more per month ($74.99 total) for a plan comparable with the original iPhone ($59 per month).
So should you buy an iPhone 3G? If you haven't bought an iPhone yet, and have been holding out for a new model, now is the time.
Hideo Nomo, who pitched a pair of no-hitters and led a rush of Japanese players to the major leagues, is finished.
Nomo announced his retirement Thursday, agent Don Nomura said.
Once known for a deceptive delivery and a devastating forkball, the 39-year-old Nomo was released by the Kansas City Royals in late April.
Nomo's 123 wins are the most in the majors by a Japanese pitcher.
He was the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year with the Los Angeles Dodgers and is one of only four pitchers to throw no-hitters in the AL and NL.
"Hideo Nomo was a trailblazer," said Hall of Famer Tom Lasorda, who managed the Dodgers in 1995.
"He represented himself and his country to the highest degree of class, dignity and character.
Out of the majors since 2005, Nomo made a comeback this year and earned a spot in the Royals bullpen.
But slowed by an injury late in spring training, Nomo had an 18.69 ERA in three relief appearances in which he gave up 10 hits, including three home runs, in 4 1/3 innings.
The first day at the world's biggest air show here in Farnborough is usually taken up by the now tedious Airbus vs. Boeing numbers game.
Monday actually started off slowly with only one big order from five-year-old Etihad Airways based in Abu Dhabi to fill the press halls as it split a massive order between Airbus and Boeing.
Now, the show can switch to where the real action is: the military.
Boeing and Airbus parent EADS are among the world's biggest defense companies.
Their never ending battle to provide the U.S. Air Force with a refueling tanker spilled over here now that the Department of Defense has to go back on the award of the contract to EADS and let Boeing try again.
EADS said again Tuesday that much of its plane is American-made and that Boeing will also source some of its parts overseas. These are global companies with global sourcing and the days of the U.S. vs. Europe are over.

The must-have apparel cotton aprons, tote bags and pouches is emblazoned with the character for "jail" inside a circle and are cut, sewn and assembled by inmates at Hakodate Juvenile Prison on the northern island of Hokkaido.
The items first went on sale in October 2006 as souvenirs for tourists and prison visitors, but didn't immediately catch on.
The line's popularity suddenly picked up last year when a government-backed corrections association began to carry the logo at its Tokyo outlet store, said Shoji Nakajima, an official at the Correctional Association for Prison Industry Cooperation.
With orders flooding in on the association's Internet shopping site, all items are currently sold out.
The popularity has been so great it is planning to register the logo designed by a prison official with the patent office, Nakajima said.
"We thought the character for 'jail' would turn people off, but that turned out to be the big appeal," Nakajima said. "Especially, young people seem to like it.
The association also sells hundreds of other items, ranging from furniture and portable shrines to tea cups and green tea, produced by more than 81,000 inmates at 70 Japanese prisons as part of compulsory prison labor.
Many inmates are assigned to unskilled labor such as assembling shopping bags and envelopes, but Nakajima said he hoped Hakodate's success can be a good lesson for other prisons to become more creative.
The Hakodate inmates don't get any bonus from the booming sales and any proceeds will be used to fund the labor program, he added.
"Our customers have said the design is cool, despite what the logo means.
They often ask where they can find them," said the bar manager Mariko Yoshida, 52.
ALWAR, India (CNN) At birth, Usha Chaumar's life story had already been written.
As a Dalit, the lowest level in India's complex caste system, she was a so-called scavenger, a person who collects the garbage, feces and urine of other higher caste people.
In the eyes of many, that would make her too disgusting to touch.
Traditionally, the age-old Hindu caste system is a social hierarchy that determines what occupation a person should pursue.
Broadly, the system has four major castes and thousands of sub-castes.
Officially, the caste system has been outlawed, but millennia of tradition have left deep dividing lines in Indian society.
In the town of Alwar in the northern state of Rajasthan, there are about 300 so-called "untouchable" women working in this profession.
India has laws against "manual scavenging," as it is called.
But the work is still around, in part because of the poor sanitation system in India.
In many parts of the country, especially in rural India, many toilets are dry bucket toilets (named for the way they are shaped) that are not hooked up to any pipes.
The waste just drops to the ground below.
Now 56 former "untouchable" women from Alwar are getting their wish.
The U.N. deemed 2008 the Year of Sanitation to bring awareness to the importance of proper sanitation.
The former "untouchables" of Alwar were invited to New York to illustrate that point and also be honored.
In New York, the spotlight shone on the women, as they strode down the runway modeling the blue saris that they now design and tailor.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) Police in the Gulf tourist hub of Dubai say they've detained 17 foreigners for allegedly displaying homosexual behavior in the city's shopping malls and other public places.
Police spokesman Zuhair Horoun says all the suspects are men who were either visiting or working in Dubai.
He says they were detained Wednesday but did not elaborate or give details about their behavior.
But the Dubai-based Gulf News reported Thursday that police detained "40 cross-dressing tourists."
The paper quotes Dubai's police chief as saying the arrests are part of a campaign against "transvestites.
Outward homosexual behavior is banned in the United Arab Emirates.
Despite its Western outlook, Dubai is a conservative Muslim city-state and like much of the Arab world remains largely hostile to homosexuality.
(CNN) Tomatoes are again safe to eat, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday, weeks after the food was blamed as a source of a salmonella outbreak in the United States and Canada.
The source of the outbreak still isn't known and 20 to 30 reports of the illness are coming in per day but the FDA said the epidemic is "waning."
The FDA hasn't determined whether tomatoes were a source of the outbreak, but it has determined that tomatoes currently in fields and stores are safe, said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's associate commissioner for food protection, according to The Associated Press.
Salmonella Saintpaul a rare form of the bacteria has infected more than 1,190 people in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Canada since April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 370 of those people became ill on or after June 1, the CDC said.
At least 224 people have been hospitalized.
Two elderly men with pre-existing conditions died while infected with Salmonella Saintpaul, and the FDA said the infection could have contributed to their deaths.
MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) It was 90 years ago Thursday that Russia's last royal family was executed but this year's anniversary comes with scientific proof ending years of speculation that some of the Romanovs managed to survive.
Medical, forensic and ballistic tests conducted in several U.S., Russian and Austrian laboratories identified bone and tooth fragments unearthed last summer as belonging to two missing children of Czar Nicholas II.
Chemically damaged and burnt remains found outside the city of Yekaterinburg in 2007 are those of Crown Prince Alexei, 13, the last emperor's only son and heir to the throne, and his sister Grand Duchess Maria, about 19, according to the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor General's Office.
"The remains that were found belong to Alexei and Maria. We can say that with certainty," Vladimir Solovyov, a senior investigator with the committee, told a news conference Wednesday.
Bolsheviks executed the czar's family and a few servants July 17, 1918 in the basement of a home in Yekaterinburg.
But the two children's bodies were missing for decades, leading to persistent hopes among royal supporters that one or both of them had survived.
Although the investigative committee stated the remains belong to Alexei and Maria, its report said scientists will nonetheless continue comparing DNA from the remains to that of the living Romanovs.
NEW YORK (CNN) Oil prices fell below $130 a barrel for the first time in more than a month Thursday, as a dramatic slide entered a third day along with a sharp sell-off in natural gas.
The declines accelerated amid growing concerns about the weakening U.S. economy.
Light, sweet crude for August delivery dropped $5.31 to settle at $129.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices have fallen more than $15 in just the past three days.
Natural gas futures for August delivery fell more than 8 percent Thursday, marking their biggest one-day drop in nearly a year, according to Nathan Golz, researcher at Wachovia Securities in St. Louis.
A number of market observers say there was nothing supporting the run up in natural gas prices, which peaked in early July, and that this week's sell-off of oil has only helped speed the declines.
The immediate cause of Thursday's sharp natural gas decline was a larger-than-expected build of U.S. supplies.
by 104 billion cubic feet to more 2.31 trillion last week.
GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN) The youngest son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was arrested and charged in Switzerland for allegedly beating up two of his servants, his lawyer said Thursday.
Hannibal Gadhafi and his wife were taken into police custody on Tuesday after an incident at a luxury hotel in Geneva, lawyer Alain Berger told Swiss radio.
The couple, who face charges of bodily harm, making threats and coercion, were released on bail Thursday, he said.
Berger said Gadhafi had spent the last two evenings in detention. His pregnant wife, who came to Geneva to give birth, was transferred to a maternity unit, Berger said.
The Swiss daily Tribune de Geneve reported that two of Gadhafi's domestic servants claimed Gadhafi and his wife repeatedly beat them at the President Wilson Hotel, which is just next door to the United Nations' human rights office.
The pair allegedly hit the servants with a belt and a hanger, the report said. It said a Tunisian woman was hospitalized.
Berger said Gadhafi and his wife rejected the allegations.
The 32-year-old Gadhafi has had previous run-ins with the law.
In 2005, he was convicted by a French court for striking his pregnant companion in a Paris hotel.
He was given a four-month suspended prison sentence and a euro500 (US$790) fine.
WASHINGTON (CNN) Barack Obama's campaign announced Thursday that it raised $52 million last month more than double the amount rival John McCain brought in, according to campaign officials for the presumed Democratic presidential nominee.
As the money comes in for Obama, his campaign is investing in states that have traditionally been Republican strongholds.
Obama's campaign now has $72 million cash on hand, meaning that's how much they currently have to spend, campaign officials said Thursday.
The average donation to Obama in June was $68, the officials said, bringing the monthly total to more than twice the $22 million raised in May.
At that time, the Illinois senator was locked in a fierce primary battle with Sen. Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Obama was spending more time campaigning for votes and delegates than simply fundraising.
With the conclusion of the primaries in early June and Clinton's suspension of her campaign just days later, Obama's campaign cash numbers had been expected to rise in June.
McCain's campaign raised $22 million in June, its best month yet. The campaign said that combined with the Republican National Committee, it has about $95 million cash on hand.
In a fundraising e-mail to supporters, Obama Campaign Manager David Plouffe acknowledged the deficit, saying "McCain and the RNC together still have a huge cash advantage, and we need your help to close the gap.
But when Obama's funds are combined with the Democratic National Committee's funds, he has $92 million, meaning he's about on par with McCain.
Obama will receive no federal money but is free to raise and spend as much as he can.
If he continues to raise large amounts, he could have an advantage over McCain when it comes to campaign cash in the crucial months of September and October.
Ronaldinho arrived at AC Milan on Wednesday to join Kaka and Alexandre Pato in an all-Brazilian attack that AC Milan are convinced will fire them back to the top level of European football.
The fee was considerably less than the $50.7m that Barcelona said Manchester City had offered, but Ronaldinho had his hearts set on Italy.
I really wanted to come to Milan. A lot of things happened and at the end I became Rossonero (red-black)," Ronaldinho told Milan's TV station as he prepared to sign a three-year deal.
"I'm happy to be here and I hope I can provide a lot of joy to Milan's fans.
"It's great to find so many Brazilians, and also so many other champions wearing the Milan jersey.
Milan finished a disappointing fifth in Serie A last season and were eliminated by Arsenal in the second round of the Champions League.
The real estate market might be slumping, but not for Donald Trump, who sold his Palm Beach mansion for $100 million, his spokeswoman said Wednesday.
"In an age of so many people getting hurt in real estate, it shows that you can still do well in real estate," Trump told The Associated Press in a phone interview.
His spokeswoman says $100 million is the most ever paid for an estate in the U.S., though there is no way to verify that claim.
Russian fertilizer billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev purchased the roughly 60,000 square-foot oceanfront home, which Trump fixed up after buying it for about $41 million in 2004.
He assigned renovations to "Apprentice" winner Kendra Todd,
who dressed it up with marble and 24-karat gold fixtures, even in the bathrooms.
The home, called Maison de L'Amitie, is spread over several buildings and includes separate coat closets and bathrooms for men and women off the main entryway for easy entertaining.
"I think it's a great sign for the area, a great sign for Palm Beach and all that Palm Beach represents," Trump said.
Britain's Treasury says a planned fuel tax increase has again been delayed because of soaring oil prices.
Treasury Secretary Alistair Darling said the postponement of the 2 pence (4 U.S. cent) per liter increase in fuel tax would help motorists "get through what is a difficult time for everyone.
Automobile Association President Edmund King said he was delighted since road users had not been looking forward to "government-inflicted pain."
Stocks got a big bounce back Wednesday as investors welcomed encouraging news from the banking and airline sectors.
Falling oil prices also helped spark a strong stock market rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) gained 277 points to end the day more than 2.5% higher.
Wednesday's rise marked the largest one-day increase in the Dow since April 1.
The Dow rallied back after ending Tuesday at its lowest level since July 21, 2006.
The Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) index also added 2.5%, and the tech-laden Nasdaq composite (COMP) gained 3.1%.
The rally came despite a reading showing a jump in inflation.
The Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, soared 5% in the past year - the biggest annual jump in more than 17 years.
Record gas and food prices helped the index jump to levels that outpaced the average annual pay increase.
However, the market turned higher quickly after the open as traders absorbed several positive corporate results.
Investors welcomed the news as a sign of relief on pressured markets.
"The market can't go down forever," said Harry Clark, chief executive of Capital Management Group. "Investor sentiment was so negative that any news can now be taken as a positive.
WASHINGTON (CNN) The No. 1 need right now for some of the builders of the nation's next spaceship: Lots of urine.
Space program contractor Hamilton Sundstrand is seeking urine from workers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, as part of its work on the new Orion space capsule that eventually would take astronauts to the moon, according to an internal memo posted on the Web site Nasawatch.com.
The need is voluminous: 30 liters a day, which translates into nearly 8 gallons. Even on weekends.
Designers of the Orion, which will park unoccupied in space for up to six months while astronauts work on the moon, have to solve a pressing issue of getting rid of stored urine, said John Lewis, NASA's head of life support systems for Orion.
"Urine is a mess because urine is full of solids," Lewis said. Those solids clog the venting system for dumping pee, so keeping the waste disposal system clear is "really a challenge," he said.
NASA has a long-standing tradition of collecting samples from its workers to help design better space toilets because "you can't make fake urine," Lewis said.
The Connecticut-based company building the Orion toilet needs the large volume of urine (about the daily output of 30 people) to work on urine acidity problems, said spokesman Leo Makowski.
The memo seeking daily contributions from July 21 to July 31 was not meant to go public, he said.
LONDON, England (CNN) Ronnie Wood entered a rehabilitation facility Wednesday for help with alcoholism, said a spokeswoman for the Rolling Stones guitarist.
"Following Ronnie's continued battle with alcohol he has entered a period of rehab," the spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity as required by her agency. "His close family and friends say he is seeking help and look forward to his recovery.
Wood, 61, has fought a long battle with alcoholism during his rock 'n' roll career, which started in the 1960s when he played with the band The Faces.
His spokeswoman didn't release any details about the treatment he will receive or the clinic that he entered.
The craggy guitarist had seemed to be in good health in recent years.
He has developed a strong second career as an artist, selling his paintings at some of London's respected art galleries.
But he has been the focus of feverish recent newspaper reports about his resuming drinking.
(CNN) An 80-year-old man was forced to undergo emergency surgery to have his leg amputated following a hospital blunder in which the broken limb was encased too tightly in a plaster cast.
Tom Talks, from Rochdale, northwestern England, also suffered a heart attack and renal failure brought on by the shock of the operation, he told the UK's Press Association.
The plaster cast was fitted at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury, near Manchester, two months ago after Talks broke his right leg when he fell whilst walking his dog.
But he said hospital staff had dismissed his complaints that the cast was too tight, telling him to "take stronger painkillers.
"The pressure in my leg was such I felt as though it was trying to burst through the skin. I was begging and pleading with them to release the plaster because I couldn't stand the pain," he told PA.
Two days after the cast was removed, Talk's doctor warned him that the leg had "died" and told him that his life was in danger forcing surgeons to amputate the leg above the knee.
Talks, who remains in hospital, opted to undergo the operation because he feared his 84-year-old wife would be unable to cope by herself and said he hoped the blunder would not be repeated.
"Obviously it was an error.
I should have had my leg attended to but because it wasn't I've lost my leg.
But anger never does anyone any good in my opinion, I'm a forward-looking person.
All I'm hoping for is this is shown up so this doesn't happen again.
As she plays marbles with her brothers and sister, Nujood is a portrait of innocence, with a shy smile and a playful nature.
But what happened evokes anger and shame.
Asked if what she went through was torture, she nods quietly.
Nujood's parents married her off in February to a man in his 30s whom she describes as old and ugly.
Her parents said they thought they were putting her in the care of her husband's family, but Nujood said he would often beat her into submission.
Nujood then turned to her family for mercy.
Nujood's parents, like so many others in Yemen, struck a social bargain when they decided to have their daughter wed.
More than half of all Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18, according to Oxfam International, a nonprofit group that fights global poverty and injustice.
"There is always a fear that the girl will do something to dishonor the family: She will run away with a guy, she will have relations with a boy.
So this is always the phobia that the families have," said Suha Bashren of Oxfam International.
Bashren calls the tradition of child brides in Yemen a national crisis. She works with young girls to protect them from early marriage, abuse and one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.
BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) Colombian President Alvaro Uribe admitted Wednesday that the symbol of the neutral Red Cross organization was used in a hostage rescue mission that freed 15 people from leftist rebels two weeks ago.
Uribe made the admission after CNN reported on unpublished photographs and videos that clearly showed a man wearing a Red Cross bib.
Wrongly using the Red Cross logo is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions.
The man was a member of the Colombian military intelligence team involved in the daring rescue, Uribe said in an address carried on national TV and radio.
The president said that as the constitutional head of the armed forces, he takes full political responsibility for what he described as a slip-up.
"This officer, upon confessing his mistake to his superiors, said when the [rescue] helicopter was about to land ... he saw so many guerrillas that he went into a state of angst," Uribe said. "He feared for his life and put on the Red Cross bib over his jacket.
However, the confidential military source who showed CNN the photographs that included the man wearing the bib said they were taken moments before the mission took off.
Uribe said he was sorry for the mistake and has apologized to ICRC officials.
There will be no official sanction against the man wearing the bib, he indicated.
BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) Five Lebanese militants, including a convicted murderer, received heroes' welcomes Wednesday as they returned to Beirut from Israel as part of a prisoner swap.
Once in Beirut, convicted murderer Samir Kuntar who was the longest-held Lebanese prisoner in Israel told a crowd of thousands he'd continue to fight for the liberation of the Palestinian territories.
"I return today from Palestine, but believe me, I return to Lebanon only in order to return to Palestine," Kuntar said.
Kuntar convicted of killing a man and a girl in Israel in 1979 and the other four were released by Israel and crossed into southern Lebanon to cheers.
They then were flown to Beirut, where Lebanese President Michel Suleiman called them "our dear liberated heroes.
The other four are Lebanese militants captured during the Hezbollah-Israel war two years ago.
Israel on Wednesday also released the remains of 199 fighters from Lebanon.
Earlier Wednesday, Hezbollah released to Israel the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who had been abducted in 2006, the Israel Defense Forces said.
The bodies "were positively identified by representatives of the IDF Military Rabbinate, the Medical Corps and other forensic experts at the Rosh Hanikra crossing," the IDF said.
Goldwasser's will be in Nahariya and Regev's in Kryat Motzkin.
McCain received the most cheers when opened his address with praise for his rival.
By the end of his speech, which focused on education reform, the crowd was on its feet, giving McCain a respectful standing ovation.
The audience cheered McCain's promise to reform the education system and expand opportunities for minorities.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (CNN) Swedish officials say a theme park ride has collapsed in a city in western Sweden, injuring 30 people.
However, SOS Alarm rescue service spokeswoman Monica Grandin says no one has received life-threatening injuries after the Rainbow ride collapsed at the Liseberg theme park in Goteborg.
She says a total of 30 people had been taken to hospital with injuries ranging from bone fractures to shock.
Goteborg police spokeswoman Malin Sahlstrom says some people were thrown out of the ride and squeezed as the seating platform tipped to one side.
She says that 36 people were aboard the ride when it collapsed and that the National Board of Accident Investigation will start an inquiry.
The Liseberg manager on duty, Peter Andersson, said it appeared that the accident was caused by a malfunctioned ball bearing.
"As far as I know, it is a ball bearing that has slipped out of its holding," he said.
Andersson said the attraction had been through a security checkup in the spring, when no faults were discovered.
Liseberg is a popular tourist destination in Sweden and the biggest fun fair park in the Nordic region, with more than 30 rides
SHANGHAI, China (CNN) The site of the Olympic sailing competition is "basically" free of the bright-green algae bloom that recently carpeted the sea off the Chinese city of Qingdao, an official said Tuesday.
The sea-blanketing algae bloom, which officials blamed on natural causes, had disrupted practice for the more than 30 Olympic sailing teams already there.
The Chinese government had set a goal of clearing the sailing area by Tuesday.
It's hard to find the green algae, especially in the Olympics sailing site," Wang Haitao, vice president of the sailing committee for China's games organizing committee, told The Associated Press by telephone.
In an extreme effort to save the site for next month's Olympics, the Chinese government in past weeks called on thousands of soldiers, volunteers and fishing boats to help remove the algae.
While the site of the Olympic competition is clear, the cleanup continues outside the barrier of fishnets and canvas being used to keep the algae out of the competition area.
"Yesterday, we sent out 1,700 fishing boats to search for algae over the whole sea area in Qingdao, but they only got 10,000 tons ," Wang said. "Compared with days before, that's big progress.
Thirty-seven national teams are now training at the site, he said.
The Olympic Games open August 8 in Beijing, and the sailing competition off Qingdao begins the next day.
SYDNEY, Australia (CNN) Young Roman Catholic pilgrims attended religious classes throughout Sydney on Wednesday morning, a quiet recovery after a Mass and pop concert thronged by more than 100,000 people the night before.
The second day of the World Youth Day celebration offered a relaxed schedule, beginning with "time for silence for reflection," according to the pilgrims' official handbook.
Afternoon events include a pilgrimage walk to the downtown St. Mary's Cathedral, barbecues at hundreds of venues around the city, and a beach party at Sydney's famous Bondi Beach featuring a rapping American priest.
Pope Benedict XVI, enjoying a final day of rest before joining the events, sent a daily text message to pilgrims' cell phones: "The Holy Spirit gave the Apostles and gives u the power boldly 2 proclaim that Christ is risen! - BXVI.
Nearly 250,000 people registered for World Youth Day, more than half from overseas.
The scale of the event was revealed when pilgrims arrived in droves and gathered along a waterfront Tuesday near the landmark Sydney Harbor Bridge for a twilight Mass, beginning with a procession of groups from 168 countries waving their national flags.£®
TOKYO, Japan (CNN) &#8212; Two hundred thousand boats sat idle in Japan, as fishermen across the nation took to the streets on Tuesday to protest skyrocketing fuel prices.
The strike the first ever by the country's fishermen hopes to convince the government that without its intervention, rising fuel costs will kill the fishermen's businesses.
Across Japan's fishing ports, fishermen simultaneously blew their whistles in a symbol of solidarity, and operations ground to a halt.
Thousands of others rallied in downtown Tokyo, marching in circles around the fisheries ministry and chanting, "We're dying," through bullhorns.
They want the government to provide subsidies to make up for the price hike.
KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) Lawmakers in Nepal will vote Saturday to pick the country's first president since it became a republic.
The country's newly elected Constituent Assembly abolished a 239-year monarchy following elections in April.
But with no one party winning a majority of the seats, it is unclear who may become president.
But a president will swear in whoever is picked as the new prime minister.
The three main political parties continued to negotiate over whom to name president.
The Nepali Congress wants outgoing prime minister and party president Girija Prasad Koirala for the position.
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) wants its leader.
But the Maoists which won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority do not favor either of the two men. They want a non-political figure as president.
The housing finance crisis and spiraling energy costs will remain a drag on the U.S. economy for the rest of the year, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers in a gloomy presentation about the economic outlook.
"The economy continues to face numerous difficulties, including ongoing strains in financial markets, declining house prices, a softening labor market, and rising prices of oil, food, and some other commodities," Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee early Tuesday.
The nation's top central banker warned "many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress, in part because the outlook for the economy, and thus for credit quality, remains uncertain.
The Senate panel was meeting to hear from Bernanke about the economy and to consider the crisis at mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as growing fears about bank failures.
Shares of Fannie and Freddie on Tuesday continued the recent slide that has prompted the Treasury Department and Fed to step in and offer support.
Shares of Fannie (FNM, Fortune 500) plunged 27% on Tuesday, leaving them 64% lower this month.
Freddie (FRE, Fortune 500) shares tumbled 26%, leaving them down 68% in July.
Both have lost more than 80% of their value since the start of the year.
The Italian club said Ronaldinho would arrive in Milan on Wednesday to get a medical exam and sign a contract through June 30, 2011.
Barcelona said that AC Milan will pay $33.4 million for Ronaldinho and another $6.3 million if it clinches a place in next season's Champions League.
The transfer amount was considerably less than the $50.7 million Barcelona said Premier League Manchester City had offered.
"(If) he can get back to being the player he was, perhaps we could have a rethink," Guardiola said last month.
Ronaldinho scored 91 goals in 200 appearances in his five seasons at the Camp Nou, and helped lead Barcelona to consecutive Spanish league titles in 2005 and 2006, and the Champions League trophy in 2006.
At Milan, he will join fellow Brazilians Kaka and Alexandre Pato.
JERUSALEM (CNN) Israel is getting ready to carry out a long-awaited prisoner swap with Hezbollah after the Israeli Cabinet gave final approval for the exchange on Tuesday.
The transfer is expected at the Rosh Hanikra crossing in the western Galilee on Wednesday, and as of Tuesday night, the area will be declared a closed military zone, the Israel Defenses Forces said.
The Cabinet approved the deal in a 22-to-3 vote.
First Class Ehud Goldwasser and Staff Sgt. Eldad Regev, sparked the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah two years ago.
Israeli authorities will confirm the identities of Goldwasser and Regev before concluding its part of the deal.
Hezbollah plans a "welcome home" ceremony for Kuntar and the four other prisoners later in the day.
Part of the swap agreement was a report from the Lebanese militia Hezbollah to Israel on the status of long-missing Israeli flier Ron Arad.
Although Israel's Cabinet approved the outline of the prisoner swap two weeks ago, it waited until it could review report on Arad issued by Hezbollah before granting final approval for the prisoner exchange.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) Oil prices plummeted by the second-largest margin on record Tuesday as investors feared a further decline in U.S. demand after hearing comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
Light, sweet crude fell $6.44 to settle at $138.74 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The drop in oil was the largest single-day slide in dollar terms since Jan. 17, 1991, when oil fell by $10.56.
On that day, President George H.W. Bush withdrew oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ahead of the first Gulf War.
But in 1991, oil was trading at just $32 a barrel, so the more than $10 slide in dollar terms represented a record 33% drop.
Oil fell 4.4% Tuesday, which does not even crack the top 100 price declines in percentage terms.
On Tuesday morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that high energy prices have helped to limit the purchasing power of U.S. households.
High energy costs will remain a drag on the U.S. economy for the rest of the year, Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday.
That could result in businesses pushing a greater percentage of their high fuel and commodity costs through to consumers, he warned.
Immediately following Bernanke's speech, prices dropped more than $9, sinking below $136 a barrel, before recovering some. "There's more demand destruction than people first perceived," said Neal Dingman, senior energy analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co.
(CNN) Sen. Barack Obama called the war in Iraq a "dangerous distraction" Tuesday and said more emphasis must be placed on the battle in Afghanistan.
"As should have been apparent to President Bush and Sen. [John] McCain, the central front in the war on terror is not Iraq, and it never was," Obama said in what his campaign called a major policy address on Iraq, Afghanistan and national security.
Obama said that part of his new strategy will be "taking the fight to al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Shortly after Obama's speech, McCain attacked the Illinois senator's opposition to the surge policy in Iraq and highlighted his own proposal for victory in Afghanistan.
"Sen. Obama is departing soon on a trip abroad that will include a fact-finding mission to Iraq and Afghanistan. And I note that he is speaking today about his plans for Iraq and Afghanistan before he has even left, before he has talked to Gen. [David] Petraeus, before he has seen the progress in Iraq and before he has set foot in Afghanistan for the first time," McCain said.
then you present a new strategy."
Obama said that on his first day in office he would give the military a new mission: ending the war in Iraq.
Pointing to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's recent call for a timetable, Obama said "now is the time for a responsible redeployment of our combat troops that pushes Iraq's leaders toward a political solution, rebuilds our military, and refocuses on Afghanistan and our broader security interests."
Obama said he planned to remove combat brigades from Iraq by the summer of 2010. He also said he would send at least two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan.
Obama's speech, given at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, comes one day after he detailed his plan for Iraq in a New York Times opinion piece.
Sources familiar with Obama's plans said the candidate will travel to the war-torn country this month with two Senate colleagues, Republican Chuck Hagel and Democrat Jack Reed.
NEW YORK (CNN) Apple Inc. said Monday it has sold 1 million iPhones in the three days following the release of the latest model on Friday.
"IPhone 3G had a stunning opening weekend," said Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, in a statement.
But the launch was plagued by software problems.
All the new iPhones had to connect to Apple's servers for activation, which quickly overloaded them. Lines of customers built in stores as employees were unable to get the phones working.
Additionally, new software was released for the old iPhone, which required reactivation of those phones.
Reports of activation problems subsided over the weekend, as the servers apparently recovered, and buyers were able to activate their phones through their home computers.
The company has set a goal of selling 10 million iPhones by the end of 2008.
LONDON, England (CNN) The wife of a UK man who reappeared five years after he was believed drowned has been accused of defrauding insurance companies and lying to her own sons, UK news agencies report.
Anne Darwin, 56, appearing at Teesside Crown Court in northern England Monday, denied nine charges of laundering money and six charges of deception, the UK's Press Association reported.
Her husband John, a former prison officer and teacher, reappeared at a police station in central London in late 2007 five years after he was thought to have drowned off the coast of north-east England.
A coroner declared John Darwin dead in 2003, 13 months after his disappearance.
A strong earthquake struck Monday near some Greek islands close to the Turkish coast, according to the U.S. Geological Service.
The quake had a magnitude of 6.4, the service said.
It struck about 40 miles southwest of the Dodecanese Islands, a series of Greek islands in the Mediterranean Sea that is closer to the Turkish coast than to the Greek mainland.
The quake happened at 6:26 a.m. local time.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
MUNICH, Germany (CNN) Police say two competitors died of hypothermia and lack of oxygen during an endurance race up Germany's highest mountain.
Police and prosecutors say they have opened an investigation.
Both men collapsed shortly before arriving at the end of the race Sunday up the Zugspitze mountain on the German-Austrian border, some 2,900 meters (9,500 feet) above sea level.
Police say German and Austrian rescue teams were unable to revive the two racers and both died as a result of hypothermia and lack of oxygen.
Police say that six more people who showed signs of exhaustion and hypothermia were taken to hospitals. None are in critical condition.
The 14.6-kilometer (9.1-mile) race started in Ehrwald, Austria.
Without a hometown star to cheer for in the Home Run Derby, fans at Yankee Stadium adopted Josh Hamilton.
He certainly gave them an extraordinary show.
The Texas Rangers slugger hit a record 28 homers in the first round before getting beaten out by Minnesota's Justin Morneau in the finals Monday night.
Morneau topped a tired Hamilton 5-3 in the last round, giving him the derby title.
But the night belonged to Hamilton, a first-time All-Star who put on a dazzling power display worthy of The House That Ruth Built.
"The whole stadium, the way people responded, higher and higher you can't beat it," he said. "Them chanting my name and getting louder, it makes you more focused.
Back from eight trips to rehab for drug and alcohol addiction that derailed his career, Hamilton broke Bobby Abreu's mark for one round.
Abreu hit 24 home runs in the first round in 2005 at Detroit's Comerica Park.
"Obviously, the dream, I didn't know how many I would hit," Hamilton said in a TV interview after his huge first-round performance.
"I just feel blessed to have played here.
Asian stock markets fell sharply Tuesday, as investor confidence in the U.S. financial system eroded even further despite a government-backed plan to help beleaguered mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Every major index was in the red by midday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropping 3.2 percent and Taiwan's benchmark losing nearly 4 percent at one point.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index shed 2 percent to 12,750.10.
While losses spread across most sectors, banks were hit particularly hard as investors worried that trouble in the U.S. financial markets would spillover to Asia.
Japanese traders, for instance, were rattled by a local business newspaper report that the country's top three banks hold a combined 4.7 trillion yen ($44 billion) in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt.
Those two government-chartered companies received a boost Sunday when the U.S. central bank and Treasury Department promised to step in with short-term funding and other aid, should mortgage losses mount.
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Monday his country will step up sanctions on Zimbabwe's government and will call on the European Union to do the same.
The move comes after China and Russia used their veto power Friday to block a U.N. resolution imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, and 11 senior members of his government.
At a news conference Monday, Brown called the vetoes "difficult to justify" and "unfortunate," adding that "the vast majority of the people in the world want to see action against the Zimbabwe regime.
"We will now ourselves step up our sanctions," he said. "We will ask the European Union, at its meeting in a few days' time, to add a number of names" and corporate entities to its sanctions list, Brown said.
"I have this morning asked the treasury to work with the Financial Action Task Force to track the wealth and the assets that are owned by members of the Mugabe regime which we know are held in different continents" including Asia, Africa, and Europe, he said, "so that we are in a position to take tougher action against them at a later date.
Brown also vowed to return to the United Nations with a new resolution "if mediation does not succeed" in Zimbabwe.
The United States pushed the resolution last week after Mugabe ignored the Security Council's appeal to postpone a presidential runoff election.
particularly subprime loans made to borrowers with weak credit.
The agency made several substantial revisions to the proposed regulations it unveiled in December.
Many of the changes acknowledge consumer advocates¡¯ concerns that the rules still contained too many loopholes that would have allowed shady lending practices to continue.
But the Fed also made some concessions to industry executives, who feared increasing oversight would lead to less lending.
The new rules will apply to all mortgage lenders, not just those supervised and examined by the Fed.
However, board members said they will continue to work on further oversight of the mortgage industry.
FAA Acting Administrator Robert Sturgell said the agency will spend $400 million over the next three years installing ¡°runway status lights¡± at 20 of the nation¡¯s busiest airports, including JFK.
The lights are embedded in the concrete, but act like traffic lights, letting pilots know when runways are clear.
The lights cut runway incursions at Dallas 70 percent during a two-and-a-half year test period, Sturgell said.
NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) &#8212; Five people died in a gunfight between police and a band of robbers who held up a casino in the Westlands Suburb of Nairobi Monday morning, police said.
The dead included at least one casino employee caught in the crossfire, according to Nairobi police spokesman Charles Owino.
One of the robbery suspects escaped, Owino said.
The casino was attached to a Holiday Inn, he said.
(CNN) &#8212; Barack Obama¡¯s campaign has sharply criticized The New Yorker magazine over the publication¡¯s latest cover illustration that appears to portray the Illinois senator and his wife, Michelle, as terrorist enemies of the United States.
Specifically, the cover, published Sunday, shows Obama in the Oval Office dressed in traditional Muslim attire and Michelle with an ¡°Afro¡± hairstyle carrying a machine gun. An American flag can also be seen burning in the fire place and a picture of Osama bin Laden hangs on the wall.
¡°The New Yorker may think, as one of their staff explained to us, that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Senator Obama¡¯s right-wing critics have tried to create,¡± Obama spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement. ¡°But most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive. And we agree.
(CNN) &#8212; Eighty-six people jailed in connection with an alleged coup plot in Turkey were indicted Monday, Istanbul City Chief Prosecutor Aykut Cengiz Engin told reporters at a televised news conference.
Among the suspects are retired military officials, journalists, politicians, businessmen and others.
The suspects are alleged to be part of a ¡°terrorist¡± group called Ergenekon whose goal is to topple the country¡¯s government.
Since June 2007 police have been arresting and jailing people accused of being part of Ergenekon.
the effort there has been harassment of journalists, and news reports have said many people are being held without charge.
The Chinese government, which will be taking tough security measures when the Olympics begin in 3 1/2 weeks, issued another reminder Monday about fan behavior and what not to bring into Olympic sites.
Zhang Zhenliang, a Beijing organizing committee official, said Monday the rules were aimed at "maintaining an orderly, civilized and peaceful environment at competition venues.
Zhang ran off a list of restricted articles, which he said was similar to other Olympics. The difference with these Olympics is the repeated emphasis on order, security and decorum for the Chinese.
Banned items include guns, ammunition, crossbows, daggers, fireworks, flammable materials, corrosive chemicals and radioactive materials.
musical instruments, oversized carry-on bags, suitcases, handbags, flags of countries and regions not participating either in the Beijing Olympic Games or Paralympic Games, flags over 6.6 feet (two meters) in length or 3.3 feet (one meter) in height, banners, leaflets, posters and unauthorized professional videotaping equipment.
Also restricted are knives, bats, long-handled umbrellas, long poles, animals (except for guide dogs), vehicles (except for strollers and wheelchairs), loudspeakers, radios, laser devices or wireless devices.
no smoking, no crossing over guardrails, no use of umbrellas or standing up for a long period of time in the seating area, and no flash photography.
Nearly 80 people have been detained in recent days in a campaign that reveals a clash of customs in this traditional Muslim city-state that attracts thousands of Western partygoers.
The campaign against indecency on the beach was sparked after police detained a British man and a woman who were allegedly discovered having sex on one of Dubai's sprawling shores earlier this month.
Over the past two weeks, police have detained a total of 79 people for "disturbing families enjoying the beach" with their behavior, Zuhair Haroun, a spokesman for Dubai's Criminal Investigation Department, said Monday.
As a result, Dubai has embarked on a public awareness campaign to remind Western tourists and foreign residents that the city may have flashy hotels and glitzy skyscrapers but it also is located in a Muslim country with traditionally conservative values.
Police have installed watchtowers and dispatched undercover officers to patrol the beaches, which also will be lit up at night to curb "inappropriate behavior. "
Authorities are "taking action in response to numerous complaints" filed by people who visit the city's beaches, Rafia said. Complaints have ranged from families "offended by displays of nudity" to women sunbathers who say groups of men stare at them while at the beach.
Alcohol is freely available in hotel bars and restaurants in this regional businesses and entertainment hub.
Thousands of European and Asian expatriates live and work in Dubai, where native Emiratis make up only about 20 percent of its estimated 1.2 million residents.
But "I am not sure if I can kiss her or touch her in public" because of the new campaign, he added.
WASHINGTON (CNN) President Bush lifted an executive order banning offshore oil drilling on Monday and urged Congress to follow suit.
Citing the high prices Americans are paying at the pump, Bush said from the White House Rose Garden that allowing offshore oil drilling is "one of the most important steps we can take" to reduce that burden.
However, the move is largely symbolic as there is also a federal law banning offshore drilling.
"This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress," Bush said.
Bush has been pushing Congress to repeal the law passed in 1981.
"There is no excuse for delay," the president said in a Rose Garden statement last month.
"In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply here at home," Bush said, adding that there is no more pressing issue for many Americans than gas prices.
Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, signed the executive order in 1990 banning offshore drilling.
Sen. Barack Obama wants to keep the ban in place.
Experts say offshore oil drilling would not have an immediate impact on oil prices because oil exploration takes years.
Jamaica's Usain Bolt underlined his superb pre-Olympic form by recording the fastest 200 meters of the year at an international meeting in Athens on Sunday.
