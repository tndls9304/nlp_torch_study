Caffeine can help increase reaction time and improve performance for military servicemen who must perform complex tasks or who need help staying alert for longer periods of time, according to a new report by the National Academy of Sciences.
"Specifically, it can be used in maintaining speed of reactions and visual and auditory vigilance, which in military operations could be a life or death situation," according to the report.

Researchers are already exploring ways to put caffeine in nutrition bars or chewing gum as alternatives to coffee, Archibald said.
A similar dose of caffeine, about 200-600 mg, also appears effective in enhancing physical endurance and may be especially useful in returning some of the physical endurance lost at high altitude, the study found.

Mobile bomb-fighting robots can already inspect suspicious cars, buildings or mail for explosives or hazardous materials, according to Jan Karlsson, an expert at the U.N.
The Geneva-based commission, in its annual study of the industry titled “World Robotics 2001,” said a record 100,000 robots were installed last year, up 25 percent on 1999.
“There is definitely a much higher incentive to invest in automated technology to fight terrorists,” Karlsson said.
“It could be used in post offices, in surveillance of offices after hours and to inspect suspicious cars.”
Postal Service - whose postmaster told a Senate panel that the financial impact of the anthrax crisis could be several billion dollars - uses robots to sort parcels, but other automated equipment sorts letters.
At the same time, labor costs are more and more.”
“For industrial robots, 2000 was the best year ever,” added the Swede.
“Not only in Japan and Europe and North America, but they have also started to take off in some developing countries, for example in Brazil, Mexico, China and South Africa.”
Annual sales of robot units are estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion.
But with the cost of installing necessary software and integration systems, the total robotics market could be worth closer to $25 billion.
About 50 systems of firefighting and bomb-disposal robots have been sold through 2000 in countries including Israel and Britain.
The study, written before the devastating U.S. attacks, predicts sales of 120 systems by 2004.
About 2,300 robots work in demolition, servicing or dismantling nuclear, chemical, waste or other hazardous complexes, the report said.
Another 60 robots work in surveillance.
“Guard robots are used privately and professionally to detect intruders or fire,” Karlsson said.

China has unveiled plans for the largest water-diversion in its history and possibly one of the world's most expensive at $60.4 billion.
The project will channel water from the country's longest river, the Yangtze, to three rivers in the north, the Yellow, Huai and Hai, whose basins are running dry.
The ambitious South-to-North Water Transfer Project will move water along three channels linking the wetter flood-prone southern basin to parched northern climes.
This is just one of the latest of China's massive public works projects, recent ones including the Three Gorges hydroelectric dam, a proposed 4,000-kilometer natural-gas pipeline and the world's highest railroad from Qinghai to Tibet.
Authorities from the Water Resources Ministry plan to begin construction next year on the controversial and hugely expensive project.
Vice Minister of the Water Resources ministry Zhang Jiyao said plans for the project would be submitted for approval to the cabinet by the end of the year.
Environmental experts say the new project could cause widespread corruption, human hardship and environmental damage, and could dry up the Yangtze in 30 years.
They urge China to take simpler steps like raising water prices, curbing rampant well-digging, stopping up leaks and improving water treatment.

especially if combined with weight-training, a Harvard study of more than 40,000 men suggests.
High-intensity exercise includes running or jogging at 6 mph, while low-intensity activities include walking at a pace of about 2 mph.
Researchers also have debated whether weight-training has a big impact on the heart, since it does not give the heart and lungs the kind of workout they get from aerobic activities such as brisk walking or running for at least 20 minutes.
But in the Harvard School of Public Health study, men who engaged in weight training for 30 minutes or more weekly had a 23 percent lower risk of heart disease than men who did not pump iron.
The researchers said the benefits may result in part from reductions in blood pressure and body fat achieved through weight training.
Given the independent results from weight training, the researchers theorized that adding weight training to a high-intensity exercise program would reap even greater benefits.
The study is based on medical records and questionnaires given periodically to 44,452 health professionals from 1986 to 1998.
Participants were ages 40 to 75 at the outset.
Heart disease was ultimately diagnosed in 1,700 participants.
Men who ran for an hour or more weekly at 6 mph or more were 42 percent less likely to develop heart disease than non-runners.
Men who did brisk walking at a moderate pace of at least 3 mph for at least a half hour daily were 18 percent less likely to develop heart disease than those who did not.
There were no significant heart benefits found from low-intensity walking.

The three wage warriors and millions of fellow countrymen are busy spending future leisure time in their heads, as South Korea considers moving from a six-day workweek to the five-day version that is standard in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe.
Korea also hopes to accomplish the shift in apparent defiance of conventional economic logic.
A government proposal, strongly supported by labor unions, calls for employees to work 300 to 500 fewer hours a year
The government thinks it can pull off this trick because it did so once before.
In 1989, South Korea told companies to trim work hours to 2,500 annually from 2,700 without paring their payrolls.
The big difference this time, employers say, is that South Korea isn't the insular, command economy it was in the late 1980s and its workers aren't exploited, underpaid victims.
The economy is far more dynamic, and workers are well organized, politically active and the beneficiaries of wage increases that routinely outpace productivity.
Labor unions say there's never a perfect time, that higher wages will force South Korea to shift into more sophisticated industries and that employees and Korean society will be happier, healthier and more relaxed.
Koreans toil long hours, but they don't necessarily toil effectively.
According to the International Labor Organization, Koreans work 2,474 hours a year, compared with 1,979 for Americans and 1,859 for the Japanese.
But they're also 62% and 45% less productive, respectively.
Sleeping, eating, lounging, Internet shopping, stock trading and card playing are common during workdays that can last from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.

For Park Kang Woo, policy director of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the solution is clear:
Drop working hours to a reasonable level and you'll see fewer accidents and higher productivity.
There is a precedent.
In 1998, Yuhan Kimberly Corp., a maker of household products, switched to a five-day week without paring paychecks.
Accident and defect rates fell and productivity gains were enough to cover the reduced time, a company spokesman said.
Still, the experience of one internationally managed company doesn't reflect what might happen across an entire economy, economists say, and employers are being asked to pay out in advance what could amount to a 15% hourly wage hike for benefits that may not materialize.
Why the hurry to accomplish such a Herculean feat?
Japan took 10 years to make a similar transition starting in 1987, when it had a per capita income of about $19,000, compared with South Korea's $9,700 today.
Greece and Portugal started their switch-overs in 1997, and are giving themselves a decade as well.
And Hong Kong and Singapore are easing in that direction under a more voluntary process.
The government says the move is a way to show that South Korea is a developed nation.
The change also will boost flagging consumption, spur regional tourism and help local economies as city dwellers head for the country to enjoy nature's beauty.
"It's politically motivated," said Kim of the Korean Employers Federation.
"It's hugely popular, and the government wants to get credit for it, especially with local and national elections coming next year."
Among the many thorny issues is holidays.
Koreans now enjoy 17 national days off, two weeks of annual leave, an added day's vacation per year worked and 12 additional bonus days annually.
Large companies often add three or four more personal days, and women get an additional 12 menstruation days.
Add these to the 52 days gained by not working Saturdays, and South Korea would race to the head of the global vacation class, trumping even the cafe-lounging French.
By some counts, the days-off total could soar as high as 165, compared with France's 145 and the U.S.
Another worry is whether too much relaxation might undermine South Korea's power, accomplishments and work ethic.

An explosion rocked the Israeli town of Hadera killing at least two and injuring more than 36 people, a local Israeli official said.
Israeli TV reported that a car bomb went off next to a bus on Hadera's main Hanassi Street.

The blast was so powerful, it caused the bus to slam into a nearby store.
Several stores also caught fire.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, although "Izz el-Deen al-Qassam", the military wing of the militant Islamic group Hamas, said in a statement today it would bring death to every Israeli home.
After months of speculation, the elusive gizmo referred to as "IT" or "Ginger" has been unveiled to the public.
The ABC television program "Good Morning America" demonstrated the invention Monday, a two-wheeled, self-propelled scooter that can travel at about 12 mph.
"This is the world's first self-balancing human transporter," Kamen said.
it has a computer that does what your brain does for you.
It's got those tires that do what your feet do for you."
Kamen said the invention - called the Segway HT - will be going out in limited quantities over the next few weeks, and by the end of next year, it should be widely available.
The price is expected to be around $3,000.
Kamen's invention has won over some bigwigs in California's Silicon Valley who have seen Ginger and reportedly thrown money behind it, according to initial reports in January on the news Web site Inside.com.
Investing icon John Doerr has called Kamen a blend of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.
Apple Computer's Steve Jobs was quoted as saying that people will erect entire cities around "IT."
Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has taken a special liking to the invention, featuring it on Amazon's Web site.
News of Ginger was first uncovered when it was revealed that the Harvard Business School Press had offered Kamen $250,000 to chronicle the making of Ginger in a book with the help of a writer.
Kamen's work is based out of a Manchester, New Hampshire, lab called DEKA Research & Development.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body’s defense system attacks the tissue surrounding the joints, the places where bones are joined.
The disease affects women more than men.
Researchers from the University of Alabama in Birmingham reported their study at the yearly meeting of the American College of Rheumatology in San Francisco, California.
They studied more than 31,000 women between the ages of 55 and 69.
The women were included in the Iowa Women’s Health Study from 1986 through 1997.
The researchers studied 158 women who developed rheumatoid arthritis during that period.
They also studied women who did not develop the disease.
Women who drank four or more cups of decaffeinated coffee a day were two times more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis than women who never drank decaf.
The women who drank more than three cups of tea a day had a sixty percent lower chance of developing the disease than those who never drank tea.
Researchers from Boston University in Massachusetts reported about another study.
It involved rheumatoid arthritis among 64,000 black women.
The women were involved in the Black Women’s Health Study that began in 1995.
The researchers found that drinking more than one cup of decaffeinated coffee a day seemed to increase by four times the chance of developing the disease.
However, in this study, drinking tea seemed to increase the chance of developing rheumatoid arthritis.
The researchers said they believe these are the first studies to show a link between decaf coffee and rheumatoid arthritis.
But they said people should not stop drinking decaf or tea until more studies are done.

Diplomats generally operate on the same basis.
So when the Bush Administration presented evidence to North Korean leaders that their country was developing nuclear weapons, it expected the regime to lie about it.
A day later came the shocker.
"Yes, we've been secretly working to produce nukes," a top aide to "Dear Leader" Kim Jong Il told astonished U.S. envoy James Kelly.
And, he added, "we've got more powerful weapons"
presumably meaning biological and chemical agents.
He was not apologetic at all, says a U.S. official, but "assertive, aggressive about it."
Tightly controlled countries like North Korea typically stonewall such sensitive inquiries.
So the admission did more than just confirm long-held suspicions in Washington that North Korea, a charter member in Bush's "axis of evil," had pursued weapons of mass destruction despite a 1994 agreement to stop.
Why, everyone wondered, was Kim confessing now?
And why had Bush pressed the issue, when he was already immersed in two major global confrontations?
No wonder the Administration sat on the news for 12 days while it scrambled to figure out how to downsize the crisis.
By the time the Bush team went public with the news last week, it was also trying to reassure citizens and allies that this standoff would be addressed, at least for now, with diplomacy, not military might.
So who assisted the Koreans?
Pakistan had the Bomb but no missiles to deliver it, and North Korea is the world's most active missile proliferator, especially to customers who can't shop elsewhere.
In 1998 Pakistan tested a homemade Ghauri medium-range ballistic missile that the U.S. believes originated in North Korea.
War with North Korea, Bush told his aides, was out of the question.
He could not let Kim alter the fragile balance of power on the Korean peninsula, where 37,000 U.S. troops stand across the DMZ from a million-man army close enough to destroy Seoul, South Korea's capital, in a blitzkrieg.
By Bush's own doctrine of pre-emption, the U.S. should strike against any state with weapons of mass destruction and an irresponsible dictator.
But the consequences of attacking Pyongyang are unacceptable.
What Bush apparently never anticipated was a brazen admission that the evidence was right.

Army used a high-energy laser to shoot down an artillery shell in mid-flight in a defense industry breakthrough, the Army and the manufacturer said.
The Army and TRW Inc., which developed the weapon, said in a joint statement that the laser tracked, locked onto and fired a burst of concentrated light energy photons at the speeding shell over the White Sands test range in New Mexico.
The Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL) is being developed by TRW for the Army and the Israeli Defense Ministry.
Lasers have been used in past tests at the range to shoot down slower Katyusha Rockets similar to those fired at Israel by militant guerrilla groups in neighboring Lebanon.
"This shootdown shifts the paradigm for defensive capabilities.
We've shown that even an artillery projectile hurtling through the air at supersonic speed is no match for a laser," said Army Lt.
Joseph Cosumano, head of the missile defense command.
"Tactical high energy lasers have the capacity to change the face of the battlefield," he added.
The laser was fired from a static testbed in a carefully controlled test, but TRW officials said they looked forward to producing a truly mobile version as the program progressed.
In earlier tests in 2000 and 2001 the testbed focused on the threat of artillery rockets and shot down 25 Katyushas fired singly and in salvos.
The U.S. military has shot down dummy intercontinental missile warheads in tests both inside and outside the atmosphere using projectile weapons and is also examining the possible use of long-range lasers to burn up such warheads in flight.

Side effects from the cancer-fighting drug Gefitinib have resulted in 124 deaths in Japan.
The dead were among 494 patients who have developed debilitating lung disorders including interstitial pneumonia blamed on the drug.
The figure is up from 39 deaths by the drug's manufacturer, Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca.
Gefitinib has been taken by at least 10,000 cancer patients since it was cleared for use in Japan in July.
President Bill Clinton has unveiled a $3.5 billion five-year program called "Empowerment Zones" which is designed to revive America's troubled inner cities.
Depressed urban areas like south central Los Angeles which was devastated by riots several years ago will be targeted for government assistance as well as business investment.
Smaller sums would go to 95 other urban and rural areas.
The program rivals any of the so-called "Great Society Antipoverty" programs of the 1960s, but will this one succeed where the others failed?
In remarks at a White House ceremony the president eluded to widespread skepticism about the workability of another costly federal program to save the cities.
In 1949, then-President Harry Truman launched his urban renewal initiative.
Subsequent administrations spent billions of dollars on programs with names like "Community Action," "Model Cities," "Community Development Block Grants," and "Urban Development Action Grants."
Today, though, most of the inner cities remain essentially, shockingly unchanged, in some cases even worse.
George Peterson, urban policy analyst for the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., describes the typical inner city landscape beset by crime, poverty and neglect.
"Two-thirds of the lots are vacant.
A large part of the population is a street population that doesn't live in the houses at all.
And you have a feeling of very intense personal fear not just because you're an outsider, but the people that live there have a fear that pervades their lives."
And it's a frustration of not being able to be part of a community reinforced by this physical desolation, that once you walk in an area like this, you'll never forget it."
In our Focus report, Bob Dody examines the plight of U.S. cities in the 1990s and what's being done to revive them.
Conference of Mayors in Washington, U.S.
"Their policy prescription is simple.
There are things that are working."
But the evidence as a whole indicates otherwise.
"Civilization as we know it is beginning to unravel around us and an increasing violence is a primary cause.
And there's no doubt about it from my over thirty years of experience in law enforcement and now the last two years as mayor of San Francisco."
Violent crime is the number one problem in American cities, like Chicago where Matt Rodriguez is the police superintendent.
"Chicago experienced a 9% decline in homicides last year, but murders of young people, ages 11 to 20, rose to record levels.
Three out of every ten murders in Chicago now involve victims in this age group.
And 92%, 92% of them are killed with firearms.
Nationwide children under the age of 18 are 244% more likely to be killed by guns today than they were in 1996."
John Rich sees many crime victims in the emergency room.
"In a given evening there may be three or four individuals who come in, who've been shot or stabbed as well as people with a number of other health problems.
I mean, many times what happens, specifically as the people are taken into the trauma room, many times rushed up to the operating room, their wounds are cared for, they're hospitalized many times with severe, severe injuries such that they require sometimes life support for a period of time."
Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr., chairman of a task force on hunger and homelessness for the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, offers a startling profile of many people who are homeless.
"Over 50% of the people that are homeless are employed.
The salaries or the wages that they're making are just so, so little that they cannot afford basic rent or can't afford to buy a home.
A lot of times when people think about someone being homeless, they think about the man sleeping on the park bench or the lady walking down the street with the bags.
43% of the people that are homeless are women with at least two children.
So those are the invisible homeless people that we really don't see, and that's one of the things that we really need to be focusing on."

Neither was testimony from astronauts or even photographic evidence.
So NASA has commissioned a mini-book to show that, indeed, Americans did land on the Moon.
Most humans on Earth accept that U.S. astronauts first got to the moon aboard the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969.
But those who don't believe have created a sort of cottage industry of doubt, and that is what NASA wants to combat.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has dealt with the controversy for decades, without much fanfare, but Roger Launius, NASA's former chief historian, said the questioning intensified in 2001 after the Fox television network aired "Conspiracy Theory:
Did We Land on the Moon?"
Those who doubt the Apollo moon landings maintained the United States lacked the technology to send humans to the Moon and was so desperate to appear to win the space race against the Soviet Union that it faked the moon mission on movie sets.
The doubters said the fake was done so poorly that there is ample evidence of fraud, including a picture of astronauts planting the American flag that allegedly shows the flag rippling in the wind.
The skeptics contended there can be no breeze on the moon, so the picture must have been faked.
But when the astronauts struggled to plant the U.S. flag in the lunar surface, they twisted it around a bit before it stuck, and that naturally created ripples in the flag.
But on the Moon, the rippling went unchecked, making it look as if it were being carried by the wind.
The site's creator, astronomer Phil Plait, was blunt in his condemnation of the doubters, whom he calls conspiracy theorists.
"The craziness involves people who think that the NASA Apollo Moon missions were faked," Plait said on the site.
"There are lots of rumors spreading around about this, and rest assured they are all completely false.

The average man probably does not consider saving wildlife when popping a dose of Viagra, but two scientists suggest that the tiny pill could save tens of thousands of animals.
Traditional Chinese medicines often rely on specific body parts from certain kinds of animals to treat common physical ailments, such as erectile dysfunction.
Jan Vertefeuille, a representative of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), said other popular Western drugs have not had an impact on traditional Chinese medicines.
Cao Dan, a specialist in Chinese medicine with the WWF, said there is widespread Asian suspicion toward many Western remedies like Viagra.
"One of the reasons for this strong hesitancy to Western medicine is concern about side effects," she said.
Viagra, for instance, has caused cardiac problems in a number of its users.
Impotence is not a primary focus in traditional Chinese medicine, but the price that men are willing to pay for a cure is significant.
And Viagra is an attractive alternative because of its low price and availability.
Some conservationists think that there are better explanations for the sluggish trade in a handful of Canadian animal parts.
Seals can be harvested for organs other than their genitalia, they say.
Moreover, the decline in animal part exports from Canada coincided with the economic meltdown in much of Asia.

South Korea has the most effective education system of the world's richest countries, with Japan in second place and the United States and Germany near the bottom.
UNICEF said it based the study on five different tests of 14- and 15-year-olds to determine their abilities in reading, math and science.
What is new about the study is that it averages the results to give the most comprehensive picture to date of how well each nation's education system is functioning as a whole.
"The blame or credit does not go exclusively to a nation's schools.
It is clear that educational disadvantage is born not at school but in the home," said the report.
UNICEF spokesman Patrick McCormick said the study had been unable to draw conclusions on a range of factors, such as how much was spent on education.
The study also didn't get into whether extreme competition was a factor in Japanese or Korean results.
"Germany, with its strong educational and intellectual tradition, occupies 19th place out of the 24 nations," just behind the United States in 18th place.
The United States, however, finished low in each test and in adult literacy.
McCormick said the study had not attempted to explain why the United States had fared badly.
"The countries that economically are very diverse, with big immigrant populations, with lots of moving around, with a huge poverty gap, probably are going to show these sorts of results with education itself."
More than $1.5 billion in government grants for homeless services will go to cities, up from $823 million this year.
Another well-funded federal program for cities is the National Service Act of 1993.
The $800 million initiative offers more than 20,000 young people a minimum wage salary plus $5,000 for college tuition in exchange for a year of service in city schools, hospitals and police departments nationwide.
National Service Program Director Elie Segal acknowledges that some of the mayors might have doubts about the new group known as "Americore."
"Ask the mayors of Texas with you today?
The mayors of Texas know because last summer they saw and learned as 87 Americores swept through the state of Texas and in the course of eight weeks immunized over a 104,000 little kids.
"And I ask you to remember the words of Edward Gibbon as he described the collapse of Athens two millenary ago.

' My friends, this is not going to happen here."
"I believe that job training is, if there is a single, and there's not, but if there were to be a single most important issue, it is that.
The ability to allow someone to hold a job, to be trained for that, a meaningful job, not flipping hamburgers, but a meaningful job, therefore entitling them to the opportunity to raise a family and to achieve all those kinds of things that we talk about on a regular basis."
And last month the administration unveiled its plan to create what are known as "Empowerment Zones" in six large cities and one mid-sized city as well as in 95 urban and rural enterprise zones.
A $3.5 billion package of grants and tax incentives entices businesses to relocate in depressed areas, create jobs and revive the local economy.
Which is the wrong approach according to New York Times magazine writer Nicholas Leeman, author of the recent article titled, "Rebuilding The Ghetto Doesn't Work."
Leeman argues that empowerment zones in every other city revitalization plan since President Harry Truman's Urban Renewal Initiative in 1949 is based on the premise that the newly-hired poor will choose to remain in the slums.
Leeman notes that in fact many have actually moved out.
A pattern, he says, that has been repeated millions and millions of times over the decades.
Robert Rechter, a domestic policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, argues that, in his view, the government continues to waste billions of dollars in a misguided effort.
"The reality is that if additional federal money would have cured the problems of America's cities, we would've cured them long, long ago.
Since President Lyndon Johnson launched the war on poverty, which is largely an urban war, back in 1965 the United States of America has spent $5 trillion on welfare, much of it going to the inner cities of the United States.
Rechter adds that, as he sees it, dependence on welfare keeps many poor people in squalid conditions.
"One of the problems with joblessness in the inner city today is that the unemployed classes in the inner city have basically lost their historic mobility.
When jobs dry up in an area conventionally Americans move to other places where jobs are, and most research indicates that one of the problems in some of our inner city areas is that when the jobs dried up in those areas, the people did not move on, even among blacks."
"Blacks are historically a very mobile population in our society.
In many cases, the areas in the inner city where they live, they migrated to them within a generation ago.
The question is why when jobs dry up in those areas they're not moving on into more lucrative locations, and the reason is that the welfare system, our housing subsidy system and all of our manifold welfare programs, heavily subsidize them to remain where they are and to remain unemployed."
Robert Rechter concludes that the main problem facing American inner cities is not a lack of government funding or services but the disintegration of the family and the collapse of moral values.
But preaching to people doesn't necessarily get results, says George Peterson, an urban analyst with the Urban institute, a Washington, D.C. think tank.
And I think there is a political consensus that's emerged that the right way to do that is to set up as many, and encourage as many community organizations, community groups, activities
the same kind of things that make the suburbs an interesting place for children to live.
For example, in terms of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts and in church activities, after school activities, there's a dearth of that kind of supportive organization in most poverty areas."
In San Francisco, Mayor Frank Jordan tells a personal story about the importance of closeknit communities.
His mother died when he was ten years old and his father became what is now known as a single parent.
"We didn't have foster families in those days.
The neighbors pitched in and they helped us for awhile.
I lived with even an elementary classmate of mine.
The parents knew of the situation and took me in because they were in the immediate neighborhood.
The church helped out as well.
They found ways to just spontaneously start to get involved as a community.
So l had an extended family and a support base that was very, very helpful to me."
Frank Jordan stayed out of trouble, he says, because friends and neighbors saw a family in need and they helped because it was the right thing to do.
America's troubled inner cities will experience a renaissance, he says, when people get back to helping each other as if they were family.
Commentator John Active traces his roots a long way back in the Bethel, Alaska, area.
He thought he knew who he was.
All this time I thought I was a full-blooded Yupik Eskimo, and now I am told I am not.
For over 40 years I have been proud to be Yupik and reveled in the honor of Yupik-hood.
I relished feasting on fermented fishheads, liked dressing in furs, and had even become an expert at purchasing fresh ice at the supermarket.
I didn't want to go around the rest of my life being a half-baked Alaskan.
I telephoned Juneau, the capital of Alaska, and spoke with a specialist who knew about the natives' enrollment in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
The act was in compensation for land unfairly taken away from Alaska natives more than 30 years ago.
Nearly a million dollars and millions of acres of land have been paid out.
At that time, in order for the natives to be compensated, an enrollment to certify eligibility was undertaken.
And in order to expedite the count, people were hired, predominantly non-Alaskan, who know little about us.
So I'm assuming they guessed at our blood quantum.
The enrollment specialist told me if I wanted to change my statistics, I'd have to go through my tribal organization.
Today I find myself hesitant to tell new acquaintances my ethnicity.
I don't know but I've always had a fetish for spears, swords, togas and laurels.
When I was young I hoped to grow up to be an Indian, and would have had some sports team name their mascot after me.
I'm Long John Active.
Since I'm only half-Yupik, should I call myself a "Yup" or a "Pik"?

At a recent party for politicians, businessmen and military officers in Moscow, Anastasia fit right in.
With her shoulder-length, bleached-blond hair and long fingernails painted bright red, the compact 19-year-old (weight 51 kilograms, height 162 centimeters) could have been taken for a date, a mistress, a party girl.
She coolly eyed guests as they wandered in and out of the restaurant.
And instead of a purse, she carried a Makarov pistol in a holster beneath her loose jacket.
These days in Russia, bodyguards have become as unremarkable as the occasional disappearances of Boris Yeltsin.
The bodyguard business is good, thanks to the country's soaring crime rates and bloody mafia feuds.
But not every protection-minded Russian wants to employ a beefy guy in a wide-shouldered suit.
Hence Anastasia and the handful of other women bodyguards currently at work in the country.
That's our strength."
"That's right," says Taisia Plotnikova, the editor of a new Russian magazine called Bodyguard.
"They don't have to be very big and strong.
They just have to be very well trained."
Julia Teryokhina, 26, who works for the Alex Agency in Moscow, reports that she lost seven kilograms and was covered with bruises after undergoing two weeks of martial-arts training.
Anastasia is one of four women who just completed a two-year program at Tandem, a small bodyguard school on the outskirts of Moscow.
Oleg Huriev, who runs Tandem, trains his students to adapt to business settings.
They take classes on computers, psychology and one called "businesswoman's image", along with the more traditional instruction in karate and the use of firearms.
"The market," Huriev says, "is open for them."
Are women up to the job?
Many of the men who run security agencies don't think so.
They view female candidates skeptically, arguing that they can't manage physically or that their clients come in expecting to hire men.
As the sole woman bodyguard at Alex, Teryokhina admits that she has worked only for foreign businessmen, who don't think the idea of female bodyguards is odd, or for the spouses of local businessmen.
And she doesn't expect such attitudes to change quickly.
But the women have plenty of satisfied customers.
"We were very happy with them.
They were completely professional," says Tatiana Andreeva, the director of the Miss Moscow beauty contest, who used the Tandem school team to guard the competition this year.
"This is a real discovery."
Anastasia and her fellow female classmates are convinced they are on to something.

Brazil actually is far more conservative that the beach scene at Ipanema would suggest.
Abortion is illegal.
Few women dare suggest their lovers wear condoms for fear of insulting them, or being considered prostitutes.
The entertainment industry rejects such subtleties.

What Celeste has is one of the most feared bacteria found in hospitals:
It preys on the sick and vulnerable, causing deadly blood infections, pneumonia, toxic shock.
Fortunately, Celeste doesn't have the bacteria in her bloodstream;
she's only a carrier.
But Staph kills an estimated 60,000 Americans each year, more than die in car accidents, and killing the bacteria has become almost impossible.
Staph has evolved, mutated and become immune to antibiotics.
Today, only one antibiotic is effective against the kind of Staph Celeste has:
But how long will it hold up?
tens of thousands of additional deaths from a "Super Staph", an "Apocalypse Bug" no drug can defeat.
"The question now more asked is, "Why haven't we seen it yet?"
It's not, "Will we see it?
" So we're just very, very close to a situation where antibiotics are becoming obsolete."
"But it's still shocking to think that there are bacteria out there that we cannot treat.
that's not the way it was supposed to happen."
Why is this happening?
In simple terms, misuse of antibiotics.
patients who don't finish an antibiotic prescription, kill off the weakest bacteria, allowing the strongest to survive.
"If the bacteria is not killed and it becomes resistant, it can leave the individual and go to somebody else.
I think we see bacteria that are literally laughing at all the antibiotics.
In this rural setting outside of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a woman has made medical history.
Her case proves how resourceful bacteria have become.
"So I figured, operate Friday, she'll be out of here Monday or Tuesday, and then..."
Carol Rothermel, a nurse, thought the operation on her sister Joan Reigh would be routine.
But Joan ended up in the hospital 322 days, primarily because of infections she developed after surgery.
Doctors fought the bacteria with heavy doses of antibiotics, including Vancomycin.
But over time, the germs developed resistance and took their toll.
Henry Fraimow, an infectious disease specialist, was trying to figure out why, after six months of antibiotics, Joan was still sick.
As the name implies, it's already become immune to Vancomycin and every other antibiotic.
But in Joan's case, the organism made one more unexpected evolutionary leap.
"We were flabbergasted by what we saw."
What they saw is on this culture plate smeared with Joan's bacteria.
A disk of Vancomycin is in the middle.
"And you can see the only place on this plate that the bacteria are growing, are around that disk containing the Vancomycin."
The bacteria not only resist the drug, but have evolved to the point where they thrive on it.
In response, doctors stopped giving Joan Vancomycin, and the bacteria died.
This was the first time ever scientists had seen the new bug, but it won't be the last.
That adaptability worries scientists.
"I can't see that this problem is going to get better.
All that's going to happen is it's going to get worse."
They have a special team on standby to race to any emergency.
How serious is the war with these organisms?
"Microbes have been around for three billion years, and we've been around for a lot less time than that.
The Internet today has the same feeling of excitement that virtual reality had three or four years ago.
Not a day goes by without another news story on the information superhighway, businesses starting to use the Internet, government plans for Internet controls, privacy and porno on the Internet, or the varieties of information which the Internet offers.
The possibilities for news stories are as wide as the Internet itself.
Those who do not using the Net yet wants to know what it is and how to get there.
The Internet is a huge network of networks.
A network is a group of computers joined to a host computer or server by modems or by cables.
These connections let the client computers communicate from one server to another.
On the Internet, all kinds of computers can communicate directly with each other and enter into thousands of different networks.
To get onto the Internet you need a computer, a modem or cable connection, and a service provider, a way of entering the Internet.
Businesses, colleges, and government offices generally have private links between their computers and the outside world.
Individuals work through a commercial provider like America Online, CompuServe, or, in Japan, NiftyServe and TWICS.
One other thing that is needed:
Department of Defense created a computer link between defense companies and universities doing military research.
Three computers in California and one in Utah were able to have easy contact with each other.
Over the next 30 years, this became the Internet, a global network which has more than 140 million users.
Numbers of users are likely to double over the next year as more people buy personal computers and turn on to this new information tool.
Most present users of the Net simply exchange information with other people.
Messages can be typed direct to another address or to a bulletin board for people who share a similar interest.
After the Kobe earthquake, for example, hundreds of people used the Internet to find out about friends and family in the area.
In February, Mastercard introduced a program to let its customers pay bills via the Internet.
More and more of the bulletin boards on the Net are for buying and selling.
The most obvious purpose of advertising / is to inform the consumer / of available products or services.
The second purpose is to sell the product.
/ The second purpose might be more important / to the manufacturers / than the first.
The manufacturers only try to persuade customers / to buy the product / by creating a desire for it.
They know all the different motives / that influence a consumer's purchase.
/ Furthermore, / they take advantage of this knowledge.
The consumer may want to copy the football star / by using the product.
At other times, / people buy products / to get the attention of other people.
Other purchases are for pleasure / rather than need.
Tickets to a baseball game or to a rock concert / are examples / of this kind of emotional motive.
Of course, / need remains the most important reason / for buying something.
Food is a real need, / but / what about the sugarcoated breakfast food / advertised on television?
/ It is neither necessary / nor nutritious.
What causes or motivates the shopper / to buy this product?
Most likely / it is an emotional motive.
Imagine driving from Maine to Maryland virtually nonstop, breezing through hundreds of miles of turnpikes and bridges, never stopping at a tollbooth.
This traveler's dream is actually a step closer to reality.
The governors of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont agreed to work toward setting up a multistate system of ETC, Electronic Toll Collection.
Under ETC, tolls would be electronically deducted on the fly, as they already are in some states.
Traffic congestion costs the nation about $100 billion in lost productivity annually, so improving highway efficiency can be a boon.
But privacy advocates say ETC could turn highways into massive surveillance systems.
Besides raking in tolls, transportation departments also can suck up tons of personal information about a traveler, including driver's license data, license plate number, destination, highway speed, vehicle identification and time of day of travel.
Who controls this information?
Will it be sold or merged into other databases available to insurance companies, credit bureaus, marketers and law-enforcement agencies?
Indeed, privacy advocates say ETC billing should be as anonymous as the coins tossed into tollbooths.
The technology already exists for anonymous ETC.
"New Jersey's system is indifferent to your identity," says Commissioner of Transportation Frank J. Wilson.
And AT/Comm, a Massachusetts company, operates the North-South Tollway west of Chicago, the largest ETC installation in the country, with over 200 lanes and more than 10,000 drivers billed electronically.
"The decentralized system is organized not to pry into drivers' privacy," says spokesman Michael Greenstein.
Another ETC company, Dallas-based Amtech, can install systems using digital cash, which would afford complete privacy.
Electronic toll collection is clearly in its infancy, and state planners are only now confronting privacy issues.
The first running shoe was invented 100 years ago.
But it took 80 years for the industry to get out of its starting blocks.
Today about 300m pairs of what Europeans call trainers and Americans call "athletic footwear" are sold around the world each year.
The average keen American jogger runs 20 miles (32km) a week.
So he or she could be buying a new pair every six months.
Of course, few wear out their shoes that fast:
most buy sports shoes to feel sporty without feeling sweaty.
But changing fashion wears out shoes just as fast as running.
It is a marketeer's dream industry, combining fashion, utility, health, fitness, glamour and personalities, all tied together with megabuck advertising.
But it is showing signs of premature ageing.
Most of the growth in the $13.5 billion global sports-shoe market is expected to come from emerging markets.
This has not yet bothered America's Nike, which has emerged as the market leader.
Nike announced a 55% increase in pre-tax first quarter profits on sales up 38% compared with the same period last year.
Nike has 23.8% of the world market, compared with 20.4% for America's Reebok and 10.8% for Adidas, a German family company.
But this order has changed repeatedly over the past decade, and could do so again.
Until the mid-1980s, Adidas was the clear leader.
But, the death of the founder's son left the firm adrift.
Nike stepped in, with expensive advertising and promotion.
Its trick was to sign up famous sports personalities to equate the brand with their success.
Nike persisted with this marketing strategy even when American and European teenagers tore off their sneakers or trainers to don British Doctor Marten boots and other grungy fashion footwear of the early 1990s.
Now fashion has swung back its way, and Nike is reaping the reward.
After early success in developing a new market for shoes for women, Reebok has trailed in Nike's wake.
A bigger threat to Nike is a revived Adidas.
After a disastrous period in the hands of Bernard Tapie, the firm was bought in 1993 by Robert Louis-Dreyfus, another French businessman, who had earlier helped to revive the ailing Saatchi & Saatchi advertising group.
Louis-Dreyfus has moved all but 3% of production from Germany to Asia.
The workforce is down from a peak 14,300 to 5,500;
Adidas has another advantage:
it makes a wide range of sports clothes, too, whereas three-quarters of Nike's and Reebok's sales are from footwear.
Analysts reckon sales of sports clothing will grow faster than the shoes market.
Adidas's pre-tax profits for the second half of last year more than doubled on sales which rose by about 10%.
Its next target is America, where it hopes to double its current low market share, at Reebok's expense.
But most of the future profits of the sports shoe business will be won in Asia.
That, as they say in the industry, is where the feet are.
What would you say about someone who spent 18 hours a day online?
Not a research scientist, but a stay-at-home mom from Texas.
What if she lied to her husband about the monthly phone bills, as high as $400?
What if you heard that her marriage dissolved and she became estranged from her children.
She worries about what's going to happen as more Americans encounter the Internet.
"I believe it could be really bad and really dangerous for this country."
Glenda may be as far overboard in her assessment of the future as she was in her computer use.
But she's certainly not alone in fretting about the infinite web's potential to collapse into an all-absorbing black hole.
Some experts estimate that 2 to 3 percent of the online community have serious Internet addictions.
Kimberly Young, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has submitted a paper on the problem for the next American Psychological Association meeting and would like to see the disorder added to diagnostic manuals.
Rich Barrette, an Ohio University grad student, started his Webaholics web page a year ago after watching the academic careers of two close friends go down the drain.
It has since drawn 200,000 visits.
There are also Interneters Anonymous, and the 300-member Internet Addiction Support Group, founded by a New York psychiatrist.
Kenneth Gergen, a Swarthmore College professor and psychologist, is a little more tactful but no less discouraging.
It can certainly sound that way.
Stella Yu, a college senior from Carson, Calif., says she's struggling with her obsession.
She first went online in the late '90s.
Now Yu, 21, drags herself out of bed at 5 a.m. to squeeze in a few hours online before school.
She logs on between classes, and then, later, at her part-time job.
Once home, the surf's up until bedtime at 1 a.m.
"My whole day is planned around this," she says.
Her grades have fallen, and so has the ax at home, where she argues with her father over phone bills as high as $450.
"I always make promises I'm going to quit;
that I'll just use it for research.
I use it for research for 10 minutes, then I spend two hours chatting."
Still, Yu stops short of calling herself an addict.
Indeed, Pittsburgh's Young understands the skepticism.
Steve Jones, chair of the University of Tulsa's communications department, says worry is overblown
"Widespread use can't be achieved without making us fearful that it's going to become addictive.
If we look at movies, television, books, there's always a fear that somehow they're going to keep us from making contact and creating human relationships."
After all, the average TV viewer spends more than 28 hours a week in front of the tube, while the average Interneter burns a comparatively measly five and a half hours.
But a few people do fall prey.
MIT sociologist and clinical psychologist Sherry Turkle says that while people may feel addicted, the true difficulty lies elsewhere.
Most problem onliners spend their time in chat rooms, E-mailing or otherwise communicating.
And self-described Net addicts think themselves less worthy in person than online.
People need to appreciate that if they're warm, clever, funny and kind online, then these qualities belong to them.
More and more women are in the military / these days, / and as their numbers grow, / so do their responsibilities.

Women are still excluded / from direct combat roles, / although women would be among the casualties / on today's battlefield.
And most military women / don't want to be excluded.
And / with more exposure to dangerous military missions, / many are hoping / the remaining barriers in the U.S. military will fall.
Asia is developing its industries and its economies at breakneck speed and, at the same time, creating a multi-billion dollar need for environmental solutions.
The World Bank cited the following areas as those in most need of assistance:
air pollution, water resources, deforestation and land degradation, rising energy demands, the processing and elimination of toxic waste, and dumping.
Of the international market for environmental goods and services, the Asian demand alone is expected to exceed $60 billion.
Environmental protection legislation throughout Asia is surprisingly well developed and sophisticated.
But, with the single exception of Singapore, compliance and enforcement do not necessarily follow, as governments struggle to balance the protection of the environment with the economic imperatives of development.
Peter Nadebaum, principal of environmental sciences and engineering consultants, CMPS&F, said developed countries have adequate environmental laws and policies, whereas underdeveloped countries feel they just cannot afford them.
They need to find a balance between their immediate economic survival and the longer term need to protect their environments."
In developing countries, where industrial waste is discharged directly into rivers and drains, the problem is that there is no concept of hazardous waste, therefore, the will to implement the regulations lacks any sense of urgency.
Environmental legislation comes at a high cost to countries which are trying to survive economically.
Survival calls for short-term thinking, but environmental protection is the domain of long-term visionaries.
Somewhere there is a balance.
The balance is now being demanded of their governments by the rapidly expanding middle classes of Asia Pacific.
They are setting the agenda for change in countries like Indonesia, Thailand, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, where water quality is the first focus, to be followed by air pollution and then waste management.
The Indonesian environment has outstanding scientific conservation value containing 60 to 70% of the world's biological diversity.
In contrast to many developing countries, Indonesia also has plentiful natural resources including petroleum and non-petroleum energy resources, rich soils, and closed canopy forest.
Indonesia made its commitment to the basic concepts of sound environmental management early and has a long history of integrating economic development and protection of the environment.
However, along with other developing countries, the nation could not fund all its priority areas simultaneously and consequently its environment has suffered in the process of development.
Indonesia's industrial development has been so rapid that, environmental issues have come to the fore on a significant scale throughout industry.
High demand sectors for waste water technologies include agri-business and food processing, textiles and tanneries, electroplating and distilleries.
But balancing social and environmental concerns with the interests of a growing population in search of higher incomes and living standards, is the greatest challenge of all.
Farmers, for example, have increased their incomes and more people have been able to remain on the land because of improved crop varieties, irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides which have increased the yields of farm lands.
Forests and other natural vegetation have subsequently been cleared to expand the areas under cultivation.
Shrimp farms have increased employment opportunities at the expense of mangrove forests and other natural vegetation.
Higher employment and incomes have been generated by the commercial logging industry which has been growing since the mid-1960s and is now further boosted with the dramatic expansion of the domestic plywood and other timber industries.
Mining and resources industries, especially petroleum and gas, small-scale gold mining and quarrying for construction materials, have generated economic rewards and substantial growth in employment.
New industries have sprung up everywhere, some for domestic processing of agricultural commodities and some for import substitution.
As well several million people have migrated to urban areas in search of income and employment.
All of these changes have had a significant environmental impact particularly on the quality of water, and the loss of both flora and fauna in relatively untouched areas.
Bio-diversity has been reduced.
Atmospheric pollution by particles and chemicals, and problems in the disposal of solid wastes are further environmental consequences of growth.
Many changes are taking place / in "food styles" in the United States.
The United States is traditionally famous / for its very solid and unchanging diet / of meat and potatoes.
Now / we have many different alternatives to choose from :
Ethnic restaurants and supermarkets / are commonplace in the United States.
Because the United States is a country of immigrants, / there is an immense variety.
Health food gained popularity / when people began to think more seriously / about their physical well-being.
/ i.e., / there are no preservatives to help it last longer / or other chemicals to make it taste or look better.
Fast-food restaurants are now expanding rapidly / all over the country.
/ In the United States, / speed is a very important factor.
People usually have a short lunch break / or they just don't want to waste their time eating.
America's attitude toward food / is changing, too.
/ The traditional big breakfast and dinner at 6 :
Like so many people in other cultures, / many Americans are taking time / to relax and enjoy the finer tastes at dinner, / even if they still rush through lunch / at a hamburger stand.
The introduction of environmental rules is a painful process.
The evaluation of the environmental impact of large-scale projects necessarily uses environmental expertise intensively.
Price incentives have to be examined carefully to ensure that they do not lead to detrimental environmental practices.
Commercial waste, for example, has to be costed as a cost of production component.
Subsidized rates for water supply and energy lead to resource waste.
Indonesia is looking for new technologies and management systems for waste minimization, treatment and, where possible, recycling or reuse.
There is greater coordination between those who protect the environment and those who cause it problems.
Regulations for monitoring and enforcing of environmental policies are also being strengthened.
In successive five-year development plans, Indonesia has acknowledged the strains being placed on the environment by rapid economic growth.
The Basic Law on Conservation stresses community participation and provides the basis for environmental impact assessment.
In complete contrast, the tiny island republic of Singapore, which generates a large variety of toxic wastes from its heavy engineering and manufacturing industries, has tough environmental laws.
Singapore's 2.7 million people live in 626 square kilometers.
About 48% of the island is used for commercial, residential and industrial purposes.
Around 12% is used for agriculture, while the remaining 40% comprises forests, reserves and other non-built up areas.
Important sectors of the Singapore economy include manufacturing, trade, financial and business services, transport and communications.
Heavy engineering and manufacturing are mainly located in the Jurong Industrial Estate at the southwestern area of the island.
Clean industries such as light engineering and electronics are scattered in areas near population centers.
The Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of the Environment controls toxic wastes, and the control begins when a new factory is at the planning stage.
Singapore generates a variety of toxic wastes, such as waste oil, spent solvent, spent enchant and waste sludge.
Industries which do not have such facilities are required to engage approved waste disposal contractors to collect their wastes for recycling or treatment.
Recovery and reuse of wastes is encouraged as this reduces the amount disposal.
Wastes that cannot be recycled must be treated and rendered safe for disposal.
Singapore uses various methods and technologies for treatment and disposal of toxic wastes:
- Biological treatment for biodegradable liquid wastes
- Physical and chemical treatment
- Fixation or immobilization, which binds the toxic
Most liquid wastes are treated by in-house treatment plants.
Aqueous wastes, after treatment are normally discharged into the sewer for further treatment at sewage treatment works.
Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong generates 390,000 tons of air pollution a day, which is roughly divided into sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, plus uncountable tons of suspended particulate.
The territory is also undergoing what is considered the world's largest construction boom.
Entire islands and mountains have disappeared to be used in land reclamation sites and for the new Chek Lap Kok airport.
In just one aspect of the construction, 70 million cubic meters of soft marine mud must be dredged from the seabed and replaced with 76 million cubic meters of sand excavated from other marine locations.
However, contractors must satisfy the strict requirements of Hong Kong's Environmental Protection Department.
The department has mandated 60 water monitoring stations covering Hong Kong's territorial waters and two boats to monitor dissolved oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids and temperature.
The dredgers working on the airport and related projects are also obliged to dispose of marine mud in designated sites.
They were fitted with satellite navigation positioning devices to make sure that they complied with this regulation.
In the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union, / nearly 50 out of every 100,000 people / live to celebrate their 100th birthday, / and many don't stop at 100!
/ But these Soviet old people aren't alone.
These peoples remain healthy in body and spirit / despite the passage of time.
What accounts for this ability / to survive to such old age, / and to survive so well?
First of all, / hard physical work is a way of life / for all of these long-lived peoples.
Another factor / that may contribute to the good health of these people / is their isolation.
They never eat more food / than their bodies need.
It is clear that / isolation from urban pressures and pollution, / clean mountain air, / daily hard work, / moderate diets, / good genes, / and a youthful approach to life / all contribute to the health and remarkable long life / of all these people.
- I've seen some weird stuff.

- The most important thing that... to remember when
Nevada Highway 375 shoots across the high desert landscape in what seems like an endless straight line.
It might as well be a road to the twilight zone because it takes us to a place that doesn't exist.
Somewhere beyond these mountains, two and a half hours outside of Las Vegas, there is a secret airbase where spy planes like the Stealth Fighter and the Blackbird first tested their wings.
You won't find the base on any map, but you will find it in these old satellite pictures we discovered, taken by both the Soviets and the U.S. government.
We see runways, buildings and what looks like large trenches.
What do people do there?
For some unofficial answers, we stopped at the nearest town we could find:
one dog, one flagpole and one bar called the Little A'le'Inn.
- There's things over there that... would boggle
- And I think there's a lot of aliens out there.
- You see a lot of different things that sometimes it's
- not wise to talk about.
People here tell us about seeing strange lights in the sky and about rumors of captured UFOs stored in secret hangars.
But just down the road, we hear a different story at the Area 51 Research Center.
- The alien stories that emerge around here, most of
Glen Campbell quit his job with a computer company to work full time uncovering the inner workings of Area 51.
- This is the best publicized secret base in the
- country, yet the government won't acknowledge
- How long have you been looking into this base?
- I've been here for two years.
- And what do you know about what happens in that
- I really don't know.
I know some of the routine procedures
But I don't know what's going on in
- there, and frankly a lot of the workers don't know
- what's going on in there.
It's a holdover of the Cold War.
the perfect place for a government to keep its secrets and, allegedly, the perfect place to commit a crime.
Base workers, risking imprisonment, came forward to tell us how government contractors allegedly used Area 51 as a secret dumping ground.
They describe how under armed guard classified materials were dumped into large open trenches and set on fire.
The workers tell us they developed health problems after breathing the smoke.
They say their complaints were ignored, and requests for protective clothing were denied.
Law professor Jonathan Turly represents Mrs.
Frost and base workers in a suit against the military.
- We're only asked one question to this government
- And what did they say to you?
- They said that "we don't understand the question"
- admit that it exists?
- Once you admit that the base is there, you become
- liable for any crimes that may have gone on there.
We followed Campbell and about 30 other amateur spies to a ridge on public land where part of Area 51 is actually exposed to public view.
- What do you think is hiding behind that ridge?
Just make yourself comfortable and enjoy the scenery.
- Here, honey, or over there?
- You can see some of them right now.
- Yeah, I can see them.
With a pair of binoculars, the nondescript buildings and hangars we found are surprisingly easy to see.
- The government gets to spy on us all the time,
- now we can spy back.
But, as it turned out, we weren't the only ones lurking in the desert that day.
Guards in white vehicles appeared in the distance, watching us as we watched the base.
"Disney thinks that they are so big we can't hurt them.
But when you get too big for your britches, you've got problems coming."
Why target a company that can be nauseatingly wholesome?
Because Disney is producing entertainment that AFA believes morally suspect.
Worse, Disney has extended health benefits to the live-in partners of gay employees.
As Wildmon mobilizes his zealots, is Mickey quaking in his oversize shoes?
Says spokesman John Dreyer with a shrug:
Disney is not alone.
his outfit was boycotting the retailer because its Waldenbooks division, now spun off, was selling Playboy
than AFL-CIO members got their noses out of joint because Kmart buys ads in the Detroit News, where a nasty strike is in progress.
Want to attract boycotters?
McDonald's was for years dogged by environmentalists who spread a false but devilishly persistent rumor that Big Macs contained beef from cows raised on land cleared from Latin American rain forests.
Sighs McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling:
"With 10,000 locations nationwide, we're a lightning rod for the issue."
The irony is that by the time a company gets big and visible enough to make irate consumers vote with their feet, it's too big for a boycott to affect it much.
In October, a coalition of dairy farmers, consumer groups, and environmentalists in Wisconsin announced a boycott of Monsanto, claiming that its genetically engineered products are unsafe.
Monsanto was unaware of the boycott until a reporter called the company's headquarters in St.
And what's the point in boycotting a product you never use anyway?
Christian fundamentalists in Kansas and elsewhere are swearing off Coors beer, a seemingly odd choice given the highly conservative bent of the Coors family.
But the brewer, like Disney, now buys health insurance for people whom boycott leader Fred Phelps Sr.
Odder still, Baptists don't seem to be the types who knock back a few cold ones after church.
Coors spokesman Joe Fuentes allows as how the AFL-CIO boycott of the late '80s, which included people like ironworkers and truck drivers, was a far greater blow.
In cyberspace, China seems an upside-down caricature of the real thing.
Dozens of Web sites offer critical views that are forbidden on Beijing's streets.
Pictures of the bloody Tiananmen crackdown are available.
So does Beijing fear the power of cyberspace?
Last month, Beijing signed a deal with a Dallas-based firm that will provide Internet access in all 30 province and regions of China.
Asia accounted for just a small fraction of the estimated 140 million users worldwide.
But usage in the region, which is expected to be the epicenter of global economic growth in the 21st century, has exploded.
In India and South Korea, which a few years ago opened up full service, the number of users has increased exponentially.
The number of Net "hosts"
The implications are enormous for Asian nations, where doctrines from Confucianism to communism militate against the free circulation of ideas.
That has fed a fear among governments that information would take on a more sinister, even subversive aspect.
Indeed, many look to Singapore, that unrepentant island of discipline, as a model.
Singapore authorities caused an uproar in 1994 by searching 80,000 files on a business network.
When they uncovered five pornographic images, they sent stern warnings to the offenders.
But the authorities have not been able to keep up with the Net's explosive growth.
The amount of data moving on the Net quadrupled, according to a National University of Singapore study.
Singapore's economic planners hope to turn the nation into a "wired island" in which every home and institution is connected to a central Internet gateway by the end of the year 2000.
That's a censor's nightmare.
Singapore plans to police only "public areas."
In Indonesia, the military has proposed "blacking out" objectionable information.
But for now it has focused on pumping out progovernment information.
In China, too, the government may simply drown out the cyberdissidents.
Beijing has widely advertised the new Net services even before issuing a planned set of "behavior regulations."
It is encouraging scholarly exchanges and new business opportunities.
Beijing has even launched its own official electronic magazine, The Chinese Scholar.
Some say it's overreacting.
China's fear of the Internet has been much exaggerated.
Many of these dissident groups have been online for a decade, and they haven't really subverted anything.
Environmental protection no longer means / an end to economic development;

Even the experts were stunned when they saw the data showing that the U.S. had grown fatter, not thinner, over the past 15 years.
"It just blew my mind," says Albert Stunkard, a University of Pennsylvania professor who has been studying obesity since the 1950s.
One international study discovered that Americans now lead the world in body mass.
While Stunkard and his colleagues don't have easy explanations, they generally blame various-size portions of sloth, gluttony, and genes.
Those who favor sloth as the main cause trot out a 1999 report on what caused weight gains among 12,000 Finnish adults over five years:
Low levels of physical exercise were more closely tied to obesity than any habitual eating pattern.
But if sloth is the principal villain, Americans should be losing a little weight.
Surveys show that slightly more of us were exercising in 1999 than five years earlier.
Most experts maintain that diet is more important.
It's usually easier to lose weight by changing your diet than to exercise three or four hours a day.
Still, the authorities agree that exercising is also critical to maintain normal weight after losing pounds.
Mindful of this, Lovejoy, a trim 34-year-old vegetarian keeps a decree from her superego over her desk:
a luscious poster of the "Louisiana food lovers pyramid", with pecan pie at the top and, along the bottom, gator, crayfish, oysters, and crabs.
And we continue to go out to eat
44 cents of every food dollar now goes for meals prepared outside the home, compared with 36 cents in 1980
exposing us to ever huger plates of food in restaurants that compete on portion size.

The countries of South-East Asia have rarely controlled their own destinies.
Even peace and unprecedented prosperity have not shaken the assumption that South-East Asia's fate will be decided by outsiders.
Westerners still often refer to the area as Japan's backyard or part of the yen block.
The economic stars of the region
Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia
have followed a distinctive path to development.
As a result, they are now exporting not just goods, but ideas.
The economic strategies of China and India look much more like those followed in South-East Asia, rather than the North-East Asian model of Japan or South Korea.
It is much more open to foreign direct investment.
The tigers of South-East Asia have built their booms by welcoming foreigners.
Singapore, which practically invented this strategy, now has an economy dominated by multinational companies.
The export industries of Thailand and Malaysia are also heavily reliant on foreign firms.
There is much admiration in South-East Asia for the Japanese and South Korean governments' sponsorship of steel, shipbuilding and other heavy industries.
Both Indonesia and Malaysia have tried nurturing winners, in aerospace and cars respectively.
But such efforts remain peripheral.
In Indonesia, the framework for growth has been established by a determinedly orthodox group of economists who have concentrated on macroeconomic stability and opposed subsidies.
Malaysia's state-backed car industry has yet to prove itself commercially viable.
By contrast Thailand, which has followed the standard South-East Asian strategy of luring in foreign direct investment, seems likely to become the regional hub for motor manufacturing.
South-East Asian countries have also been much quicker to let financial markets flourish.
By contrast, the stockmarkets of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia were cleared for take-off early on the path to economic development, allowing companies to raise more money without heavy borrowing.
manage the kind of economic miracles achieved in other parts of Asia, they seem likely to do it the South-East Asian way.
Both countries have set out to court foreign direct investment.
China took in $35 billion-worth in 1994 alone.
India got into the game much later.
But even its nominally Communist politicians are now eagerly scouting the world for foreign investors.
Both countries still have large state sectors.
But both now see their nationalized industries primarily as a burden that must be reformed, rather than as the fulcrum of an economic strategy.
Finally both China and India, like the South-East Asians, have encouraged companies to raise capital through their frenetic stockmarkets.
In the inward-looking economies of China and India in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, directed lending and industrial planning were a disaster.
Both Japan and South Korea rose to economic power when stable Asian allies seemed more important to western politicians than closed Asian markets.
And with Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore rattling along with economic growth rates of over 8% a year, the days when South-East Asia could simply be dismissed as Japan's backyard are over.
Most people are no more interested in / how government or politics works.

But why are some people apparently born to be lean, while others get fat on normal diets?
In one study of 540 adults who had been adopted at early ages, researchers found that the subjects' levels of fatness were much closer to those of their biological parents than to those of their adoptive ones.
Such studies have led to the consensus that weight is about 33% a matter of genes, which in turn has bolstered the idea that many of us must spend a lifetime in struggle against our heredity.
But a few years ago skeptics took a hard look at what fat people actually eat in real life and found that obese subjects consistently underreport their calorie intake by some 40%.
Normal-weight people typically underreport too, but by about 20%.
But although a naturally slow metabolism may not cause people to gain pounds, new evidence suggests that everyone's metabolism may perversely slow down when they try to lose.
In March a Rockefeller University team published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine showing that when research volunteers lost about 10% of their weight by dieting, their overall calories burned fell still further
The lower burning occurred in both normal and obese people and was due partly to metabolic slowing
as if the hand of an invisible enemy were on the body's thermostat, offsetting hard-won reductions of consumed calories.
Thus, it appears, there really is a food demon:
It's that insidious inner thermostat trying ceaselessly to keep our stored fat at a constant level.

The heavens rained news last week.
They presented conclusive evidence that stars the size of our sun have planets and those planets might be able to support life.
They saw for the first time galaxies forming at the dawn of time, thanks to pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
And they learned that at least half of our own Milky Way galaxy is composed of ordinary stuff, not exotic, as-yet-undiscovered particles that some have postulated.
Here's how to understand the highlights.
If one other planetary system is found, the argument goes, then the universe surely must contain many others.
And if another planet is found that has propitious conditions for the formation of life, then, perhaps, we are not alone.
The two planets discovered by Geoffrey Marcy of San Francisco State University and his associate Paul Butler are not the first ones ever discovered beyond our solar system.
The reason they are so exciting is that they begin to meet the test of possible life.
They orbit the stars 70 Virginis, in the constellation Virgo, and 47 Ursae Majoris, in the Big Dipper.
Both stars are about the size of the sun, and their planets are gaseous like Jupiter, only bigger.
The temperature of the planet orbiting 70 Virginis is probably about 185 degrees, allowing liquid water in "a nice toasty warm bath", Marcy says.
That's about right for complex organic molecules to form similar to those "that presumably led to life on Earth".
Water on the second planet is probably frozen.
The planet around 70 Virginis is particularly important, observes Robert Brown, a planetary systems specialist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
"It is the first find with characteristics of mass and orbit that are similar to the solar system."
The planet circles its sun every 116 days and probably was formed by the same kind of event that caused the solar system.
The discovery of the planets will spur a host of new searches.
Astronomers aren't able to see planets directly with telescopes because light from the stars they orbit is too bright.
Instead, a planet's existence is deduced from wobbles of the star around which it orbits caused by the planet's gravitational force.
The wobbles, in turn, make the wavelength of light from the star shift slightly, and the shifts can be detected from Earth.
The two new planets were found using a 120-inch telescope at the University of California's Lick Observatory.
When the Hubble Space Telescope was first proposed, astronomers wanted it to be a time machine that could look back nearly to the beginning of the universe to see what was happening.
Of course, Hubble is used for lots of other observational purposes.
For 10 days through December. 28, Williams kept Hubble trained on a narrow stretch of sky near the handle of the Big Dipper that is uncluttered by nearby objects.
The orbiting telescope took pictures during the entire time, 342 exposures in all.
Once transmitted to Earth, the frames were assembled into a single image that reveals a bewildering array of galactic shapes and colors.
Some, in fact, looked as if they were beginning to evolve into classic spiral shapes.
nearly 4 billion times fainter than can be seen by the human eye
that they have not been seen by the largest terrestrial telescopes.
Hubble, in effect, was looking at fossils that offer clues about how galaxies develop, and they are key to understanding the fate of the universe.
We are seeing some of the galaxies as they were 10 billion years ago, in the process of formation.
As these images have come up on our screens, we have not been able to keep from wondering if we might somehow be seeing our own origins in all of this.
One of the most puzzling and compelling questions for astronomers is what the universe is made of.
By studying how galaxies move, they can calculate how much mass is needed to produce the motions.
But when they count up what they see, the visible objects add up to only a 10th of the matter that is needed to account for galactic motions.
But an international team from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the University of California and the Mt.
Stromlo Observatory near Canberra, Australia, has now presented strong evidence that much of the missing stuff is ordinary matter astronomers call MACHOs
a combination that wasn't technically or economically possible until this decade
the team photographed 9 million stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud nearly every night for the past two years.
The computers watched to see if any of the stars got brighter for a period of one to four months.
If so, it meant that a MACHO in the halo of the Milky Way too faint to be seen from the ground had been detected passing between the Large Magellanic Cloud and the telescope.
The MACHO's massive gravity acts like a lens to magnify the light from the distant star and reveal that something is out there.
In two years, the team recorded seven such "microlensing" events.
That meant there are enough MACHOs in the halo of the galaxy to account for at least half the necessary dark matter.
In fact, team members say privately, other evidence they're collecting suggests that they may be finding all the matter that's needed.
Next week, more news from the heavens is expected as NASA reveals what the Galileo probe discovered as it parachuted down through Jupiter's roiling atmosphere on December 7.
We praise those people who have lived through the impossible or succeeded where others would fail.
But this week, we dedicate the first part of our show to the people who did not survive:
the more than 200,000 victims who died when the Atomic Age was born, when the U.S. dropped the first unclear bombs on Japan.
We begin our look back with the question:
Should the United States have unleashed the terrible power of nuclear weapons on Japan, or could World War II have ended in a less violent way?
This week, we put that question to three people who have given it much thought, and this is what they said.
There is no question the United States should have dropped the atomic bombs on Japan in the summer of 1945.
The Japanese were showing no signs of surrender.
They did want to negotiate.
But as we were watching their troop movements, and we knew intimate details because we'd broken their military and diplomatic codes, as we watched their military troop movements and their political maneuvering, we knew that they were waiting for us to invade.
They wanted one great invasion battle, where their kamikazes, their troops, even their civilians, could inflict massive casualties on our assault forces and force us into negotiations.
Truman had to drop the bomb.
He had no choice in the summer of 1945.
We should not have dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
I think the evidence we now have is that the Japanese were attempting to find a way to surrender, and the top military leaders of the United States, almost to a man, understood that this was not a matter of military necessity.
Moreover, the United States and Great Britain were taking their armies out of Europe, and they were about to move all of that power that had defeated Hitler to the Far East, to join that war.
And finally, the Russians were mounting their troops on the Manchurian border about to enter this war.
So, I think Japan was on its last legs, and there's clear evidence that they were prepared to surrender so long... above all, not unconditionally, but on the condition that the Emperor of Japan, a figure who played the role of a god in their culture be given some assurance that he would not be deposed.
I think that was a condition, but I also think that U.S. leaders did not see that as a major problem.
To finish the war as soon as possible, that was the understandable decision by the President Truman.
At that time, the Japanese military forces still possessed more than 10,000 airplanes, were going to be used as suicide attack, like a kamikaze, and most of the Japanese military leaders were against to surrender to the Allied Nations.
They were asserting to fight against the Allied Nations until the complete destroy of the Japanese manpower and properties.
He was looking at America and the world in the summer of 1945.
I think actually the evidence is that perhaps because a decision was made to wait, wait for the atomic bomb test, perhaps more lives may have been lost, as some historians have argued.
And I think that may be right.
One by one, / American companies are giving up / their leadership.
One example is / the flight of U.S. manufacturing operations abroad.
Over the past four years, / some 500 U.S. companies have established their factories / in northern Mexico / because of cheap labor costs.
They work solely for money.
As a result, / they are treated either as "tools" or "numbers", / rarely as human beings.
Were the competition not so great, / Americans might get away with this behavior.
But others / like the Japanese, Koreans, and Taiwanese / are only too ready / to step in and sell their quality goods / at cheaper prices.
Americans once believed in such values / as diligence, prosperity, and progress.
But new values have arisen, / beginning with the hippic creed of the 1960s.
These new values include / play, nature, and freedom.
The same holds true for Europe.

Much of what you must know to succeed in business these days is not easily learned in a book or classroom, as the surrounding article makes clear.
Acquiring key business skills, such as perceiving and controlling emotions in oneself and others, is a subtle process.
But much else of what you need is just meat-and-potatoes knowledge, things you can learn in a semester or less by taking the right course.
This will help you understand, among other things, how your company raises and allocates capital.
It will also make clear why that new product your team has designed might not be launched, despite its sensational showing in test markets.
A dismaying number of managers don't know how to read a balance sheet or a profit-and-loss statement.
So sign up for a course in these fundamentals, as well as some more sophisticated ideas.
A course that will teach you the basics of word processing and spreadsheets is essential.
You can also take instruction in how to navigate the Internet.
This is where you will learn how to target a market, capitalize on brand equity, position a product, and use market research techniques.
High-tech companies may be in particular jeopardy of drifting away from consumers.
They are so avant-garde in their skills that they invent solutions to imaginary problems while forgetting what their customers really need in the workaday world.
Learn how to talk the walk
You may know your stuff, but technical prowess won't get you to the top unless you can express yourself in written and spoken words to a variety of audiences
customers, colleagues, analysts, journalists, and many more.
And when you can do that well, you might be in great demand.
This might seem a subject too narrow for the generalist.
But it's a good bet that in this era of tightening budgets and limited commitments, your company again and again faces the question of whether to hire a permanent staff for a new project, bring in temps, or have a subcontractor far away handle it.
Sooner or later the question will wind up in your department.
This course will help you evaluate the costs and contributions of insiders and outsiders and come up with the best mix.
It will also help you avoid inflammatory combinations of permanent and temporary employees.
This is the course in which you learn how to keep people working together, even when they don't want to.
For example, you are the leader of a cross-functional team that has to identify outmoded computers and give them to a local high school.
It is hard for you to motivate team member Wilson because you have no authority to promote or fire him.
The trick is to convince his line boss that nothing is more vital to the company at the moment than community relations.
A course in team building might also instruct you in how to motivate people when there is less opportunity to reward them with bigger titles and salaries.
Take a course that will keep you and your company from violating equal-opportunity law.
But the instruction ought to view affirmative action as something more than a downside risk.
If you learn to work well in and lead a group that includes, say, ethnic minorities and handicapped workers, you may convince your superiors that you are one of the select few who can function brilliantly in a global marketplace that is ever more inclusive and complicated.
Some 45% of the world's people live in cities, a proportion which is rising rapidly.
Cities in the developing world are growing the fastest.
There are 95 cities in China with populations over 1m.
Old cities, especially in America, will continue to decline, creating social and racial problems.
And all cities will find themselves in increasing competition with each other;
this will be particularly sharp between the great cosmopolitan centers.
In 2000 there will be a growing realization that the success of cities depends on their integration with their surrounding urban areas.
In downtown Chicago and New York the top rent for office buildings in 2000 will remain at or below $22 per square foot a year (excluding service charges), with 20% or more of office space standing empty, despite several years of economic growth.
In midtown New York the vacancy level is lower and rents generally higher, although in real terms rents will remain lower than 15 years ago.
A survey of office tenants in Britain confirms a trend that is common for mature economies;
companies are seeking cost-efficient, good-quality buildings in order to remain competitive;
and city centers are generally regarded as inefficient.
The original pull to the suburbs was to be in a more pleasant place;
So which cities will do well in 2000?
The top city for attracting extra cash and visitors will be the host city to the Olympic games.
Bottom will be all cities in Africa, with many of South Africa's cities facing waves of crime that may wash away that country's much needed new investment.
Among capitals, it is London that scores best.
The attractions of the West End and the City to visitors, businesses and international investors will continue.
Since the 1990s hardly any new development has taken place.
Asset values are likely to rise and, for occupiers seeking modern office space, the occupation costs of new leases will increase.
During 2000 the 4.4m-square-feet Canary Wharf development will be fully let and, encouraged by the construction of the new Jubilee Line railway, development may commence on additional phases.
Posh London residential property will still be more in demand than its equivalent anywhere else in Europe.
Jakarta shows just how fast a city's fortunes can change.
The financial liberalization of the banking system in 1990 resulted in a surge of development.
The number of new office buildings has increased sevenfold in 15 years.
In cities such as Hanoi, Beijing and Shanghai, the story is much the same.
Strong demand from multinational companies for too few modern office buildings will create abnormally high rents.
Construction is to be seen everywhere
The world's largest city will spend 2000 licking its financial wounds.
Water and air, the two most ubiquitous natural resources on the planet, will be the focus for increasingly bitter political disputes, both between countries and within national boundaries in the coming decade.
Smog and acid rain, water pollution and sewage disposal, dams and river-flows will become ever more contentious issues.
According to the World Bank, fresh-water will become the natural resource most likely to cause wars in the 21st century.
The bank warns that the river basins of the Jordan, Tigris and Euphrates in the Middles East will become the most dangerous flashpoints.
Forget oil and land, water is where the most intractable disputes will arise in the near future.
Such is the worldwide growth in demand for water, which is doubling every 21 years, that output from new water supplies will be unable to keep pace.
Not only are the number of new sources of fresh water falling, due largely to 95% of the world's sewage being dumped directly into rivers, but tapping them can cost between two and three times more than existing water supplies.
In 2000 chronic water shortages will affect about 40% of the world's population in about 80 countries, according to the World Bank.
A billion people in the world will not have access to clean drinking water.
Dirty water already causes eight out of ten diseases in developing countries and 2000 will see more than 10m people dying as a result.
The continued increase in the global population will only exacerbate the situation.
If this were not bad enough, most of the new arrivals will be in the exploding urban centers of the developing world, where the growth of the "megacities" is about to eclipse even the great urban sprawls of the industrialized nations.
The future inhabitants of Sao Paolo, Bombay, Lagos, Jakarta and the like will live in squalid shanty towns with inadequate water and little sanitation.
What happens during the few years ahead will largely decide whether this peak in the global population will be 7.9 billion or 11.9 billion, nearly twice the number of people on the planet now.
They will need clean air to breathe.
Here there is some cause for optimism.
The effects of the ban are expected to begin ameliorating ozone destruction some time before the end of the decade, and perhaps 2000 may see the first signs of this, although 1999 ozone loss was the worst on record.
Equally effective could be legislation to limit the use of cars in the major industrial cities, where photochemical gases in summer and acidic "smogs" in winter have been getting consistently worse.
From Los Angeles to Athens, city authorities have tried to enact measures to limit exhaust emissions.
One new focus of concern are the tiny particles, called PMIOS, which are emitted from vehicles.
These particles are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs where, because they are coated with highly reactive chemicals, they cause damaging oxidation within the cells of the tissues.
There is no doubt that new environmental concerns will arise over the next few years that scientists could not have anticipated.
Who could have predicted that the sperm counts of western men would have fallen significantly over the past 30 or 40 years, perhaps because of the presence in the environment of chemicals that mimic the environment of chemicals that mimic the effect of female hormones?

You don't hear much about charisma in business school.
And you've probably never read about it in a business magazine.
To most people, it's the inscrutable X factor
Not many people have charisma.
But when you talk to those who do, you discover that it isn't such a mystery after all.
Charisma is a tricky thing.
Jack Kennedy oozed it, but so did Hitler and Charles Manson.
Con artists, charlatans, and megalomaniacs can make it their instrument as effectively as the best CEOs, entertainers, and Presidents.
Used wisely, it's a blessing.
Charismatic visionaries lead people ahead, and sometimes astray.
But you know it when you see it.
And you don't see much of it in the Fortune 500.
But those are commodities compared with charisma.
When a CEO is perceived to have charisma, his business performs better.
Even so, most leadership courses focus on follower ship and compliance and consensus management instead of leadership.
The result is a sort of guerrilla war against charisma.
Charisma matters more or less, depending on the business.
There are professions where charisma bubbles and boils and leads to success, and others where it doesn't make much difference.
Dentists, CPAs, morticians, engineers, architects, and bankers, for the most part, don't need charisma.

This simulated flight, based on The Right Stuff, a 1983 Warner Brothers movie, is the newest attraction at Six Flags Over Texas.
Not since the golden age of amusement parks in the 1920s has there been this much interest in intentionally getting one's pants scared off.
About 255 million thrill-seeking souls will click through the turnstiles into North American theme parks this summer.
The capital costs of starting a new theme park begin at $500 million.
This summer, 45 state-of-the-art roller coasters will be introduced in 41 theme parks, and theme-park operators will invest nearly $1 billion in new and existing facilities.
The real excitement will come from attractions that try to translate into rides the thrills from movies and TV.
Disney, for example, has spent an estimated $100 million over eight years on its "Indiana Jones Adventure."
Universal Studios Hollywood unveiled a live sea-war show to coincide with the opening of the film Waterworld.
And at four Sea World parks, guests can watch a stunt show with buzzing speedboats based on Baywatch, the popular TV series.
There are posters for Warner movies like The Bridges of Madison County and Batman Forever plastered throughout the Six Flags Over Texas park in Arlington.
After purchasing theme parks in Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, California and Canada for $400 million in 1997, Paramount Entertainment is using a strategy that is similar to that of Six Flags.
Capitalizing on Paramount movies like Wayne's World, and Days of Thunder, the Paramount parks have increased average attendance by about 12 percent since 1997.
MCA, another entertainment giant, has been battling Disney in California and Florida.
MCA's two Universal Studio parks, which have grown from basic movie-set tours, drew 12.3 million visitors this year.
Universal plans to keep coming at Disney through expansion, and it will build the 800-acre Islands of Adventure park in Orlando over the next three years.
The new facility will cost $2 billion by the time it opens.
The increased competition has chipped away at Disney's lucrative theme-park franchise.
But so far this year, it looks like Disney's parks will bounce back strongly.
Revenues in the second quarter increased 11.2 percent, to $891.9 million, over the same period a year earlier; operating income jumped by 19.6 percent, to $182.2 million.
Disney's overseas prospects also are improving.
Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 and lost $1 billion in its first two years.
Today, however, the park is near the break-even point.
Tokyo Disneyland, meanwhile, is the most popular theme park in the world.
The major challenges facing theme parks in the future will revolve around demographics.
With the aging of the population, parks will be competing for an older crowd, which means that attractions may have to be geared toward 50-year-olds.
Already, Disney is running ads showing a retired couple visiting Disney World in Florida.
And Viacom has opened a chain of adult playgrounds called Block Party, where adults play virtual-reality games.
But in the end, the true test for theme parks will always be how well they sell individual fantasies to the young and old alike.

"A huge portion of what Netscape is worth is Jim Barksdale telling investors it's going to work.
He has this great ability to convey confidence and give comfort.
To me, charisma is almost the definition of leadership."
And he's willing to pay plenty for it;
he and Doerr gave Barksdale an almost unheard-of 11% stake in Netscape.
Charismatic people have a remarkable ability to distill complex ideas into simple messages.
What's their secret?
They communicate by using symbols, analogies, metaphors, and stories.
Remember Jack Welch redirecting GE
going on the road to tirelessly preach his "No, 1 or No. 2" strategy requiring managers to "fix, close, or sell" any business that wasn't first or second in worldwide market share.
Barksdale uses the same technique.
When Barksdale arrived in Silicon Valley, Netscape was a chaotic corps of 100 employees, some younger than his won kids.
Engineers were panicked about product delivery deadlines.
Managers were bewildered about strategy.
Jim Clark so feared Netscape would run out of money that he had imposed a hiring freeze.
Barksdale, who calls himself "the president of doing stuff" lifted Netscape's hiring freeze, ramped up R&D, opened foreign offices, broadened the target market, and cut prices.
His message to employees:
If it fails to reach escape velocity, it will crash back to earth.
"We've got to go full speed.
We've got low barriers to entry and incredible competitors.
If we can't establish presence and a brand name, we'll die."
Inside Netscape, Barksdale promotes the strategy in two words:
President George W. Bush allowed U.S. technology firms to sell high-speed computers to Russia, China, India and countries in the Middle East, designed to halt the spread of nuclear arms.

The U.S. government has accused one of the nation's top tobacco companies of secretly developing a high-nicotine tobacco and using it in cigarettes.
The head of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration says the Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company distributed high-nicotine tobacco in five cigarette brands The tobacco product is known in the industry as Y-1.
Company spokesman Tom Fitzgerald disputes the government's claim.
They feel empty without it.
Whether they succeed or not, a remarkable thing often happens:
Their audacity enhances their charisma.
Charismatic people speak emotionally about putting themselves on the line.
They work on hearts as well as on minds.
Arthur Martinez, the former vice chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, knew he had big problems when he joined Sears last year to rescue its sinking retail unit.
Martinez met with almost all applicants who visited headquarters for jobs at the level of vice president or higher.
"I started by explaining why I took the job."
This is one of the greatest adventures in business history.
There's no model for what we're going to do.
You have to be courageous, filled with self-confidence.
How can you not do it?
Martinez has assembled one of the best teams in retailing.
Sears is gaining market share and is solidly profitable again.
Charismatics are rebels who fight convention.
They may seem idiosyncratic, but their oddball image augments their charisma.

Bain was rebounding from dire financial problems when the partners elected her chairman.
Largely because of her inspiring leadership, Bain has expanded to 1,400 employees, from 990.

Success comes from pulling emotional levers.
Like Barksdale and Martinez, Gadiesh abhors bureaucratic doublespeak, and the unthinking conservatism it usually reflects.
She flashes her wit to kill it.
A few years ago she was trying to help Chrysler executives reduce options on cars, thereby lowering costs.
The auto execs were leaning on market research to avoid tough decisions.
We can't cut that option because our average customer wants it, they said again and again.
Exasperated, Gadiesh shot back, "Well, the average customer has one tit and one ball."

But Barksdale proved himself to be fairly nimble recently when hackers cracked a security code in Netscape's software.
Barksdale quickly assembled his key people.
He let everyone toss out ideas about how to fix the problem and assure customers that the company's software is safe for navigating the Net.
Then he made an odd suggestion:
Give cash rewards to anyone who finds security flaws.
Thus far, two significant new bugs have been detected, and $2,000 in cash bounties have been paid.
Simply by offering to pony up for its mistakes, Netscape won admirers.
If you admit you made a mistake, the customer will always cut you slack.
So how do you manage charisma, this wonderful, terrible thing?
Gadiesh suggests using an internal compass.
When he returned, Byford talked with Gadiesh about the importance of "true north."
An ordinary compass, points to magnetic north, which is fickle and unreliable.
A gyrocompass, on the other hand, works on its own internal mechanical system and always points to true north.
She adopted true north as her personal guideline.
"The most important thing a leader can have is true north.
It's a set of principles that directs him or her to what's virtuous and right.
It all depends on whether it's anchored by true north."
Learning charisma from people who are loaded with it is a bit like studying acting with De Niro or playing basketball with Jordan.
Regardless of how hard you try, you may never win an Oscar or make it to the pros.
But you'll certainly improve your technique

Ten years ago Japan was revving its government-industry engine to roar ahead in biotechnology, and U.S. technocrats were scared.
Today the dynamo seems like the little engine that couldn't.
The five top-selling bioengineered drugs in Japan are licensed from U.S. companies.
Japan once led the world in microbe-based products, and it entered the biotech arena running flat out.
By the mid-1990s more than 200 Japanese companies had major programs, according to a report by University of Washington's Steven Collins.
No fewer than seven of them raced Genentech to commercialize t-PA, a blood-clot dissolver for heart attacks.
cut more than 300 deals with U.S. companies for access to their biotechnology.
But Japan's storied skill at tweaking existing inventions to optimize performance and cut costs proved irrelevant.
Further, Japan's corporate codgers had trouble keeping up with biotech's dizzying pace
unlike U.S. rivals, they seldom attracted stellar academic talent.
Says Tadashi Matsumoto, who oversees biotech R&D at Kyowa Hakko, a Japanese chemicals company:
"The quality of Japanese scientists is very good, but it's hard for them to move and change.
They are much more staked to their positions than U.S. scientists."
"Japanese companies tend not to have sales forces outside Japan, so they license rights to drugs only for the Japanese market."
Western companies can pay more for rights to biotech drugs.
bet an estimated $100 million on t-PA development but lost out to Genentech.
Chugai took a major hit when its American partner, Genetics Institute, lost a patent fight with Amgen for U.S. rights to EPO, a lucrative anti-anemia drug.
But that opened a window of opportunity for U.S. and European drug companies, which stepped in and secured rights to scores of promising drugs at fire-sale prices.
Still, many Japanese companies continue to invest in biotech, albeit more cautiously than ten years ago.
"Now we're much more interested in core technologies and partnerships that give us equal relations with U.S. companies."
Those plans are being reviewed at the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit in Amman, Jordan, by government and business leaders from about 60 countries.

As the year-end employment season is approaching, college graduates-to-be or graduates are busy seeking jobs, but their rate of employment at large enterprises remains at a low level.
On the other hand, small and medium-sized companies, especially those engaging in so-called ``3D’’ (difficult, dangerous, and dirty) businesses, are having serious difficulties in hiring workers.
In a nutshell, a strange phenomenon of concurrent labor and job shortages exists in the local market.
According to a recent survey of an employment-related information research company, the average competition ratio among college graduates to get a job in large enterprises was 67.3:1, almost similar to last year’ s 67.7
1. Until the first half of the year, many market experts anticipated that the employment scale by large enterprises would increase significantly, riding on a strong upturn of the domestic economy.
However, as the future economies of the world’s major countries have become opaque due to deepening fears of the possible ``double-dip’’ recession of the U.S. economy and an anticipated war between the U.S. and Iraq, most domestic enterprises have been making downward adjustments of their employment plans these days.
If this trend is left unchecked, the domestic job market in 2003 is feared to face its worst situation since the foreign exchange crisis gripped the country in late 1997.
On the contrary, some small and medium-sized companies are facing the suspension of their plant operations due to a failure to secure enough workers.
Based on a survey of 8,400 companies with five to 300 employees, which was conducted by the *Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade, the shortage of manpower came to 204,900 persons.
In particular, the lack of professionals and technicians with undergraduate or higher-level educations stood at 7,300 and 17,000, respectively.
As a means of solving this problem, smaller companies have been largely dependent on foreign workers.
It is not easy, however, to employ competitive ones.
To settle the unbalanced employment market problem, it is desirable for large enterprises to expand their recruitment from the standpoint of investing in future manpower and contributing to social responsibility.
College graduates seeking jobs, meanwhile, are required to reconsider their basic conception of employment so smaller companies can support the national economy by becoming better places for workers to demonstrate their abilities.

BERLIN (AP) _ Michael Jackson rewarded fans outside his Berlin hotel with a brief appearance and a glimpse of his youngest child _ dangling the toddler over a fourth-floor balcony.
The boy, his legs kicking, had what appeared to be a white cloth over his head as Jackson, briefly holding the child with one arm, displayed him Tuesday to dozens of fans waiting below the window of the luxurious Adlon Hotel.
The child, in a baby blue jumper, was the reclusive singer’s third and youngest, Prince Michael II, said Antje Sigesmund, a spokeswoman for the Bambi entertainment award ceremony, which Jackson is attending in Berlin.
About 200 fans gathered outside the hotel, just opposite Berlin’s landmark Brandenburg Gate, and security had to remove some from the lobby.
Several carried banners, including one that said ``Save the Kids,’’ with drawings of children’s faces.
Jackson, wearing a bright red shirt, smiled and waved to the fans, at one point tossing a small white towel to the crowd below.
The singer then went inside and retrieved the toddler, using one arm to hold the boy out over the iron rail of the hotel.
Fans cheered as the pop star appeared with the child, but Jackson quickly retreated into his hotel room without *making any statement.
Little is known about Prince Michael II.
People Magazine reported in August that he was six months old.
The magazine, citing an *anonymous friend, said the boy was not adopted and did not identify the mother.
In Berlin, Jackson was *taking a break from a California courtroom where he testified last week in a $21 million lawsuit claiming he *backed out of concerts.
He arrived in Berlin to pick up a Bambi Thursday.
He is to attend a benefit for homeless children and a charity auction where he will *put a jacket and hat on the block Wednesday.
There may be no kind way to lay off employees, but there ought to be a better way to talk about it.
As the leaders of America's corporations closed the books on 1999, they could look back on a gratifying year.
Their stocks boomed, with market indexes setting record after record.
Senate groused, coupled those record profits with record layoffs.
And the GOP's presumptive was only half right.
Profits in 1999, adjusted for inflation, look likely to set records.
from just over 400,000 to just over three million but all seem to agree that the 1999 figure is the lowest in several years, which is not surprising after four straight years of economic growth.
Workplace America, a newsletter published by Hunt-Scanlon Publications in Connecticut, tallied the year's 50 biggest job-reduction announcements and came up with a sum of about 375,000, the lowest since the newsletter began keeping its list in 1992.
Some of these people took buyouts or left via attrition;
some worked for a business unit spun off from the mother ship but may have kept their jobs;
some may not actually lose their jobs for months.
Be that as it may, a lot of companies had a hell of a year, and a lot of their employees a hellish one.
What were their leaders thinking?
Quoted below are the chairman's letters of the 1999 annual reports of companies that made Workplace America's list of the 50 biggest job-reduction announcements.
Kent Kresa of Northrup Grumman described the 5,400 cuts in his talented work force as being our toughest decisions

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Angry mobs stabbed and *set fire to bystanders Thursday in rioting that erupted after a newspaper suggested Islam’s founding prophet would have *approved of the Miss World beauty pageant.
At least 50 people were killed and 200 injured, Nigeria’s Red Cross president said.
The violent demonstrators in the northern city of Kaduna burned churches and rampaged through the streets until hundreds of soldiers were deployed to restore calm and enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
``A lot of people died.
We don't know yet exactly how many ... more than 50,’’ said Emmanuel Ijewere, the president of the Nigerian Red Cross.
Street demonstrations began Wednesday with the burning of an office of ThisDay newspaper in Kaduna after it published an article questioning Muslim groups that have condemned the Miss World pageant, to be held Dec. 7 in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.
Muslim groups say the pageant promotes sexual *promiscuity and indecency.
*In all honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from among them (the contestants),’’ Isioma Daniel wrote in Saturday’s article.
The newspaper ran a brief front-page apology on Monday, followed by a more lengthy retraction on Thursday, saying the offending passage had run by mistake.
In Thursday’s rioting, more than 50 people were stabbed, bludgeoned or burned to death and 200 were seriously injured, Ijewere told The Associated Press.
At least four churches were destroyed, he said.
Many of the bodies were taken by Red Cross workers and other volunteers to local mortuaries.
Many people remained inside homes that were set afire by the demonstrators, Ijewere said.
Shehu Sani of the Kaduna-based Civil Rights Congress said he watched a crowd stab one young man, then force a tire filled with gasoline around his neck and burn him alive.
Schools and shops hurriedly closed as hordes of young men, shouting ``Allahu Akhbar,’’ or ``God is great,’’ ignited makeshift street barricades made of tires and garbage, sending plumes of black smoke rising above the city.
Digital videodiscs for TVs and PCs are coming.
You reach for a compact disc and flip it into a black box.
The CD contains two full-length movies
"Snow White" on one side, "The Lion King" on the other.
The kids choose "Snow White."
phssst, in a half-second you've skipped over the previews and landed square on the best part of the animation classic, when the seven dwarfs start singing "Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to work we go ..."
The children cackle and shuffle off to bed.
You smile, and slide the disc back in its case.
The videocassette recorder may never achieve the historical status of the steam engine, printing press or PC, but there's no denying that it's one of the great inventions of the 20th century.
It gives viewers the freedom to watch any show or movie they want, when they want to.
The VCR has helped shape the slouchy postmodern man
Since the VCR's introduction in 1975, more than 800 million have been sold worldwide.
But the beloved device might soon be headed for the technological dustbin.
A new home-entertainment machine threatens to take its place.
Called a digital videodisc player, or DVD, the latest black box functions like a combination audio CD player and VCR:
it plays standard-size CDs containing high-resolution movies and digital sound.
Analysts say the new video format has a bright future as a replacement for VCRs and videotapes ― and as the successor to CD-ROM drives that have been spurring sales of home PCs.
Major consumer-electronics companies unveiled DVD players in Japan and North America in 1995.
Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm, estimated that 7 million DVD movie players had been sold in North America by the end of 1999
In Asia, throngs of middle-class consumers are already snatching up a crude progenitor of the DVD player.
"These are very popular right now," says a salesman at the Pacific Palace mall in Hong Kong.
As a medium for playing movies, discs are smaller and easier to handle than tapes, and offer nearly instant access to material.
As with audio CDs, users can fly over video segments they don't like.
First-generation digital discs store 133 minutes of video on one side.
Over the next few years, their capacity will double and then quadruple.
With even more space, content providers could store multiple versions of the same film on a disc.
Click a button on the remote and choose either the tame or lurid version of a sexy thriller, depending on who's watching.
Hollywood studios could reap big profits from the new format.
the replication cost for a videodisc will be less than a dollar.
If consumers start buying DVD boxes, software sales could zoom.
If this group of demonstrators is correct, the U.S. government is covering up the most important secret of all time:
Can any of this be true?
KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) _ Adjusting her black veil to get a better look at the computer screen, 14-year-old Fatima points to something she just typed.
’ she asks, a smile brightening her *freckled face.
``Yes,’’ answers Hashem, a 18-year-old *computer enthusiast who recently returned to this southwestern city after living in Pakistan as a refugee.
Like many Afghans, they use only one name.
Hashem is helping fellow returnee Ehsanullah Omer run Kandahar’s first and only free computer and English language training center, a project being funded by Kandahar’s governor to give men and women the ability to acquire the skills Afghanistan will need if it wants to fully join the world community.
With a small staff working in a former Taliban garrison, Omer, 32, wants to open digital ``doors’’ that will not only train Kandahar’s people for the challenges ahead, but also help them learn more about the U.S.-led coalition troops that allowed them to do it.
``Afghans have been denied the outside world and we want to open those doors,’’ Omer said. ``If they don't know how to use a computer, they can't do that.
International peacekeeping forces will be here for years.
To develop a positive attitude about these people we have to teach them who they are and where they are from.’
There are about 4,000 U.S. troops stationed just outside this city of more than 300,000 people.
The capital, Kabul, is patrolled by a 4,800-strong multinational peacekeeping force.
The center is teaching 1,450 men and about 200 women to read and write in English and training them how to use a computer.
Students range in age from 14 to 45 and lessons are in the evenings.
``They are a little weak in English, but we are improving it.
They start out learning about the operating system and then programs and applications,’’ Hashem said as he looked over a huddled group of 20 women crowded around a dozen computers.
Courses last four months and the entire training program runs two years.
Kandahar residents can enroll for free, but the school is currently running on a *first-come, first-serve basis and funding and space are already straining their limits.
Last year U.S. consumers bought 680 million tapes, valued at nearly $10 billion.
recently sold 42 million copies of "Snow White" alone, at a price of between $20 and $30 per tape.
"DVD is, ultimately, a whole new market for our classic titles," says a Disney spokesman.
Warner Home Video, a unit of Time Warner, is especially keen on the technology
it has the world's largest collection of feature films.
"This is a very important media for us," says Warren Lieberfarb president of the company.
Despite their interest, the studios will proceed cautiously.
The "content providers" are loath to cannibalize the lucrative tape-rental and sales markets, or spend heaps of money on DVD titles, until the new technology proves itself.
They don't want to stick out their necks, by spending heavily on player production, until they're assured that the most popular movies are available on discs.
Last week Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, criticized Hollywood studios for sending out "conflicting signals" about their distribution plans.
DVD players sell for at least $500.
The price of both the hardware and software will fall if and when sales grow.
Digital discs have two major handicaps.
DVD units will play only movies at first
they won't be able to record TV shows or anything else until "writable" (that is, recordable) discs hit the market.
That deficiency could save the VCR for a while.
Experts think recordable discs will find a wide audience, perhaps first with PC owners, who'll use them to store data from the World Wide Web.
The second potential problem is the gradual emergence of pay TV, or "video on demand."
In the near future, consumers may be able to order any movie over a cable, satellite or phone network.
Why buy a DVD player and discs when you can dial up a blockbuster film at any time?
Lieberfarb believes that the DVD has a "window of opportunity" to implant itself on the public psyche before networks rule the world.
The discs store seven times more data than existing CDs, and new disc drives will read that information faster.
PC moving pictures will be sharper than ever.
Compaq, Apple and other PC makers will build DVD-ROM drives into some of their computers.
"We're definitely looking at DVD as an alternative to the CD-ROMs that are being shipped today," says a product manager for Apple.
The new format "will bring PCs in line with where the broadcast industry is going.
Hiroyuki Furukawa, a vice president of Toshiba America, claims that DVD encyclopedias could feature full-screen, full-motion videos instead of small, grainy snapshots.
The capacity of future DVDs will be enormous 27 times greater than that of today's CDs.
Whether or not the DVD succeeds, digital video will play a major role in the evolution of both the TV and the PC.
The video compression chips that make DVDs possible are the key component in the direct-broadcast satellite business, which is growing rapidly in Asia, Europe and the United States by offering hundreds of channels to consumers who don't have cable TV.
and Microsoft are working on ways for PCs to receive video programs directly from satellites.
Digital video signals "the beginning of the merger between PCs and home entertainment," says Rick Lehtinen, senior analyst for the In-Stat Multimedia Group.
It's a trend well worth watching.
He could get eight years in jail.
he ER1 personal robot won't make coffee, pick up the newspaper, vacuum the floors or even walk the dog.
But beyond the not-so-cheap shots, the robot has a lot to offer.
Like the personal computer kits of the 1970s, much can be learned _ and perhaps someday much money can be made _ on the road to usefulness.
And don't forget the prestige from being the first *on the block with a robot smarter than Sony’s AIBO.
The ER1, sold by Evolution Robotics Inc., resembles neither a dog nor the robotic stars of science-fiction movies.
The 2-foot-tall, 20-pound machine is a three-wheeled platform that holds a laptop, its brains, and has a staff that carries a Web camera, its eye.
Some might confuse it with an industrial table.
All parts are included except the most expensive _ a laptop running the Windows operating system.
Plan on spending at least another $1,000 if you don't already have one.
For the mechanically challenged, Evolution sells an assembled robot for $699 (still minus the computer).
But anyone who opts to *plunk an extra $100 for the assembled version is missing half the fun.
The ER1 is more of a hobby than a toy.
It's not recommended for children under 14, unless they're supervised.
Schools might be interested in using the robot to introduce the basics of robotics and programming.
It took about two hours to assemble my ER1, which came in dozens of pieces tightly packed in a box along with 100 screws.
Once installed on the laptop, the software shows a live shot of what the robot’s camera sees, various behavioral options and the robot’s battery levels.

Retailers’ expectations may have been low for the start of the holiday shopping season, but the competition was fierce.
In Omaha, Neb., a 52 year-old woman was knocked to the ground when hundreds of people rushed the doors at the early morning opening of the Nebraska Furniture Mart.
Diana McKeever received several stitches to her knee and was released from the hospital.
In Greendale, Wis., Doreen Schellhase, 46, her two daughters and her son’s girlfriend donned Santa hats and prepared to storm the Target store before its 7 a.m. opening, equipped with two-way radios to *best the competition.
And Marvin Takar, who went shopping the day after Thanksgiving for the first time ever, *had no idea what he was *in for.
``It's unbelievable,’’ said the 42-year-old printer, staring in amazement at the swarms of shoppers at Ala Moana Shopping Center in Honolulu.
Early bird specials and marketing gimmicks drew bargain hunters to stores across the country Friday in what retailers hoped would be a momentum-building kickoff to the holiday shopping season.
Major retailers including Sears, Toys ``R’’ Us and Wal-Mart, as well as several mall operators, said shopper traffic was at least as healthy as the day after Thanksgiving a year ago.
Because the law of averages is still on the books, five elderly Americans are expected to die this week of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), an incurable and invariably fatal illness.
Also this week, odds are, one elderly Briton will die of CJD, whose cause is largely unknown.
CJD routinely claims one person per million population every year.
But no instances of the disease will be routine for a long time:
any of them could be a clue that people are now threatened by "mad-cow disease."
There have now been 11 suspicious CJD deaths in the last two years.
In the United States, activists filed a suit demanding that the Food and Drug Administration ban a practice suspected of causing mad-cow disease in Britain:
feeding cattle the rendered parts of cows and sheep.
"Eventually this practice is going to get us in trouble," warned virologist Richard Marsh of the University of Wisconsin.
Suspecting that one or more of the pituitaries had come from a CJD victim, the FDA banned the use of cadavers as sources of growth hormone.
So far, 15 U.S. dwarfism patients and an additional 80 overseas have contracted CJD from infected cadavers.
Scientists could better gauge the risk of contracting mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob if they knew what caused them.
But no virus or bacterium has ever been associated with the diseases.
According to a theory advanced by neurologist Stanley Prusiner of the University of California, San Francisco, in 1982, prions are misshapen molecules that wrap themselves around normal proteins in brain cells (diagram).
This deadly embrace transforms the healthy proteins into more misshapen prions.
The misshapen prions, in a lethal chain reaction, alter still more healthy proteins.
The change in shape makes the proteins invulnerable to enzymes that would normally break them down.
The proteins accumulate, eventually forming the clumps and holes characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
And prions from one species can sometimes infect the brains of another.
Although the British press is carrying predictions that 500,000 beefeaters a year could die of CJD associated with mad-cow disease, in fact it is very hard to contract any of the brain-rotting ailments.
For one thing, there are hints that you need to be genetically susceptible.
Thousands of patients who received infected growth hormone did not get CJD;
those who did had a particular kind of brain-protein gene.
Also, UCSF's Fred Cohen points out, a prion can alter healthy brain proteins only if it resembles them:
"The fit between the human brain protein and the bovine prion is not very good."
The question is whether it was good enough to kill 11 people in Britain.

CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico (AP) _ Prison officials in northern Mexico say their inmates are manufacturing furniture *bound for Texas _ despite U.S. laws that ban the importation of goods made with prison labor.
And they'd like to contract with more American companies to produce all kinds of goods.
One official said prison shops would even label their products to hide their origin.
Prison officials in Mexico’s northern states are pointing to inmate workshops as a way to stem the loss of business as foreign-owned assembly plants abandon the border zone *in search of cheaper labor in Asia.
Convicts already do work for Mexican companies.
But prison labor is strongly criticized around the globe *on the grounds it undercuts unions, steals jobs from law-abiding workers and poses risks of human rights abuses.
Many countries, like the United States, bar imports of products made by prisoners.
The prison director for Tamaulipas state, Manuel del Riego, said Clint Hough of Austin, Texas, is the first foreign businessman to accept the state’s offer of its inmates’ services.
Del Riego said Hough has been buying furniture made by prisoners for more than a year. Inmates at the Ciudad Victoria prison said Hough ordered chairs for a Texas restaurant chain as well as dining room furniture.
Hough, interviewed at the prison, would not confirm that he takes the furniture across the border.
Wiping sweat from his brow with a towel, Hough later denied ordering furniture from the prison at all, and said he merely teaches prisoners design and finishing techniques.
Del Riego said 150 foreign companies, including many in the United States, had expressed interest in setting up production lines at the 11 prisons in Tamaulipas.
``Companies will save tons of money,’’ he said.
On average, Mexican inmates earn the minimum wage of 45 pesos a day ($4.50), half what free workers along the border make.
Companies hiring prison labor also save on health insurance, retirement and other benefits.
A couple of hours north of Las Vegas, these desolate 98 miles of blacktop average 53 cars a day and so many UFO sightings that in February Nevada's Department of Transportation renamed 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway.
The Nevada tourism people hope this downsized corner of the state can cash in on the current mania for UFOs and all things paranormal.
They've already got Twentieth Century Fox picking up most of the tab.
In exchange, Fox used the event to promote its big action movie, "Independence Day," in which hostile aliens do the galaxy a favor by blowing up New York City.
Some of the movie takes place around the E.T.
It also makes reference to Area 51, part of Nellis Air Force Base, where the stealth bomber and Aurora spy plane were developed.
But UFO-logists say that's just the cover story:
the government is actually housing an alien craft and crew here.
Back on planet Earth, half a dozen civilians who worked at Area 51 have sued the Defense Department, claiming hazardous waste on the site exposed them to harmful chemicals.
One case was dismissed, another is pending.
The official military line is that current activities in Area 51 are classified and cannot be discussed.
Ground zero for astral travelers is the dusty hamlet of Rachel.
To hard-core believers, as the folks with saucers in their eyes call themselves, this is their Lourdes:
holy ground with trinkets for sale.
At Rachel's Little A'Le'Inn , owner Pat Travis enthuses about the mystery guests who frequent her intergalactic way station.
"The more people who come here, the better it'll be for our community."
And the governer agrees:
"If E.T. comes back, we'd like it to be here in Nevada.
Most people, when they look to the skies, see friend or foe.
Marcus Pizzuti, a commercial artist who recently moved to Rachel believes Area 51 contains spacecraft with "antimatter annihilation reactors" powered by alien substances that are way off the periodic table.
Some might say the same about Pizzuti.
A conspiracy theorist who also goes by the name PsychoSpy, Campbell sent the governor a 25-page letter of protest against turning the area into a tourist trap.
He worries that interlopers will run afoul of the camouflaged security guards who guard Area 51.

Many smokers, especially young *trendsetters, have switched to French-made Gauloises, which they say are similar in taste and a dollar a pack cheaper.
American cigarettes, particularly Marlboros, have been the main target of a boycott of U.S.-made products organized several months ago by Palestinian activists.
The campaign has resonance among many Palestinians upset by what they see as Washington’s one-sided support of Israel.
Two other famous American exports _ Levi’s and Coca-Cola _ have largely escaped the sanctions.
At more than $50 a pair, Levi’s were out of reach for most Palestinians anyway.
Coca-Cola is bottled in Ramallah _ the Palestinian administrative headquarters in the West Bank, meaning a boycott could endanger jobs.
``The United States is backing Israel to continue the occupation of our land,’’ said 24-year-old construction worker Fadi Suleiman.
The former Marlboro man and most of his buddies now smoke Gauloises.
``Maybe the boycott will be a message to the Americans to open their eyes and stop being pro-Israeli.’
Marlboro had always been the most popular cigarette in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, favored especially by Palestinian men in their 20s and 30s as a status symbol;
most Palestinian women don't smoke.
Wherever men gathered _ at work, for card games in all-male coffee shops or even at stone-throwing protests against Israeli occupation _ most smoked, and the brand of choice was Marlboro.
The only exception was in prison in Israeli _ a *waystation for tens of thousands of Palestinians _ where only Israeli brands are available.
Anti-American sentiment has peaked in the past, during the first uprising from 1987-1993 and during the 1991 Gulf War, but never before has an anti-American boycott succeeded.
The sales of Marlboros appeared to begin declining in the West Bank about a year ago with the introduction of Gauloises.
Hassan al-Zain, 60, who has been selling cigarettes in Ramallah’s central Manara Square since 1954, said that only a year ago, he used to sell 10 packs of Marlboros a day.
Now he is selling 10 packs of Gauloises and two packs of Marlboros.
Other vendors confirmed the trend.
Ulcer pills for warts?
Pharmaceutical manufacturers cannot promote such "off label" uses to physicians or to the public, since the drugs were not screened for those purposes.
And because doctors still rely heavily on drug makers for information, many are unaware that many drugs do double duty.
Researchers are free to publish papers on off-label uses, of course, but their findings rarely reach the lay media.
It is perfectly legal for doctors who discover or hear about a drug's off-label use to prescribe it;
The American Medical Association says that off-label prescriptions account for up to half of all those written.
Whether yours might be one of them is well worth knowing.
If so, your doctor and pharmacist should be able to justify the choice.
The catch is that not all off-label uses have been thoroughly studied.
Some have become accepted, among them antibiotics for certain ulcers and etidronate a drug that regulates bone metabolism
Others are based on one doctor's experience with one or two patients.
And because off-label uses bypass the lengthy clinical trials and the FDA's scrutiny for safety and efficacy that approved drugs must endure, their risks and side effects are open questions.
A study of 13 pregnant women, for instance, suggested that a nitroglycerin patch normally used to prevent angina, delayed premature delivery when applied to the abdomen during preterm labor.
In 1987, Orlow began prescribing the drug for children as a pain-free alternative to surgery.

That is not always the case with off-label drugs.
Insurers have no consistent standards on coverage.
Many will pay up if doctors deem a prescription "medically reasonable and necessary."
Cimetidine for warts, clonidine for sleeplessness and bethanechol for speech problems haven't yet made it into Drug Evaluations or the U.S.

KUWAIT (AP) _ Massoumah al-Mubarak knows the power of democracy in Kuwait.
When Kuwait’s emir decreed women should have the vote, the *freewheeling Parliament _ a rare symbol of democratic ideals in the Persian Gulf _ used its constitutional powers to overrule him.
A week later legislators rejected women’s suffrage again in a separate bill.
``This is what they are so proud of here,’’ said al-Mubarak, a professor of international relations and prominent women’s activist.
``They use the tools of democracy to undermine democracy.’
Nearly 12 years ago, U.S.-led forces drove Iraqi occupiers from Kuwait amid promises of political equality in Kuwait, promises that made it easier to *sell Americans on a distant war to protect a tiny, wealthy autocracy.
As U.S. troops mass here for a possible second war against Iraq, Kuwaiti democracy remains an ideal that is usually discussed using comparisons.
``Compared to the other countries around us, Kuwait is very democratic,’’ said Waleed al-Tabtabai, a conservative Muslim lawmaker.
``Saudi Arabia or Qatar, their councils are just *veneer.’
``In Kuwait, anybody can run and elections are free,’’ he said.
That, however, depends on the definition of ``anybody.’
Of the 2.3 million people who live in Kuwait, only about 115,000 are registered voters.
Nearly two-thirds of the population are foreigners, many of whom perform low-status jobs in the oil-rich nation.
Of Kuwait’s 860,000 citizens, the excluded include people under 21 and naturalized citizens of less than 20 years’ standing.
Members of the military and the police also are barred, to keep the forces from being politicized.
Most conspicuously absent, from polling booths and candidate lists, are women.
``It's only a democracy of the few,’’ al-Mubarak said.
Just across the border in Saudi Arabia, women face employment and social restrictions and aren't even allowed to drive.
Kuwaiti women are legally protected in the workplace and in education.
They hold key business jobs and a few occupy top diplomatic and government posts.
When it comes to governing, many Kuwaitis still believe a woman’s place is far from Parliament.
Smoke has been getting in the eyes of tobacco companies lately.
Whistle blowers like Jeffrey Wigand have said cigarette makers knew all along their product was addictive.
The Food and Drug Administration is looking to strike while the ash is hot.
The agency wants to ban all pictures and images in print ads for tobacco in any publication whose readership isn't at least 85% over 18 years of age.
Can the FDA do that?
Would the ban crimp businesses like advertising and publishing?
And would it reduce smoking in America?
The answers seem to be maybe not, probably not, and unclear.
Non-tobacco industry lawyers think the FDA may be overstepping its authority.
"Our concern is not with tobacco but with the power of government to undermine the First Amendment rights of business."
tobacco accounted for 9% of advertising revenues.
Ads for cigarettes have since fallen to about 3%.
Smokers are the most loyal consumers in the world.
And they aren't likely to quit if their brand is no longer shined in glossy four-color.
However, if limiting glamorous ads would prevent young people from taking up smoking, the FDA's ban might not be such a bad thing.

BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Rain drips through the wooden roof of the ancient Church of the *Nativity, a cold and nearly empty place except for a few monks and a couple of children begging for change.
Just two weeks before the holiday, there are few signs of Christmas in the town where tradition holds Jesus was born.
Israeli soldiers patrol Manger Square after occupying the town for the third time in recent months.
There is no Christmas tree in the square, no decorations, few pilgrims.
Through fog and wind, Palestinians rush around on streets *chewed up by tank treads to buy food before the soldiers shout for people to get back inside.
For a third year, violence overshadows preparations for Bethlehem’s Christmas, a holiday that used to draw tens of thousands of tourists and was the lifeblood of the town’s economy.
This holy town has been a place of despair for the last two years.
A massive force of Israeli soldiers shut down the town for more than a month in the spring as troops hunted Palestinian militants they believed were behind suicide bombings in Israeli cities.
On Tuesday, candles flickered and burning incense wafted through the church.
A woman with a wrinkled face and long, gray-black hair swished a broom to push puddles of rain water into a pail.
A couple of children begged strangers for money.
Built like a fortress over what Christians believe is Jesus’ birth cave, the 4th century stone and wood Church of the Nativity became a place of violence.
For 39 days, Israeli battle tanks and rooftop snipers surrounded the church, where gunmen *hid out and survived on boiled grass and well water.
Ancient frescos and a statue of the Virgin Mary were pocked by bullets, and several rooms *gutted by fire during the standoff.
Israeli troops reoccupied Bethlehem’s streets for two months this summer and again three weeks ago, imposing curfews to clear the streets except for a few hours every fourth day.
During one such break Tuesday, Jack Giacaman, 30, hurried to finish carving olive wood nativity figures he promised he'd have for a priest by Christmas.
IBM hasn't done that, hopes never to have to.
It's hardly a surprise that one of the main reasons people like to work for IBM is the company's all-out effort to maintain full employment."
Can it really be 20 years ago that IBM included the above paragraph in a book it handed out to every employee?
Its employees, of course, bought into it completely.
Didn't IBM dominate the mainframe computer industry?
Hadn't it always taken care of its people, even those who were only minimally competent?
If they wore the blue suit and went where the company sent them and did what the company asked of them
if they committed completely to IBM
then they were taken care of for life.
That was the deal, and there was nothing implicit about it.
It was right there in black and white.
And then, seemingly out of nowhere, along came Microsoft.
Along came the rise of the personal computer and the decline of the mainframe.
Along came the commoditization of hardware and the primacy of software.
Which is to say, along came the one true constant of capitalism:
And there was IBM, saddled with 405,000 loyal workers and a sacrosanct no-layoffs policy, watching in anger and bewilderment as its new, more nimble competitors ran rings around it.
By the mid-1980s, when IBM finally abandoned its "full employment" stance and started downsizing, it wasn't just fighting to retain its position as king of the hill
it was fighting for its very life.
Today it employs around 300,000 workers, and while no one expects it to regain its former lofty position, no one expects it to go out of business anytime soon, either.
They ruin morale, corrode loyalty, and cause tremendous pain to employees who, through no fault of their own, find themselves out of work.
They are clearly at the heart of the tremendous anxiety so many Americans feel.
It is a chilling place few visitors will ever forget:
the sights and sounds of hatred, prejudice and genocide.
China’s Mao Tse-tung had his ``Little Red Book.’
’ Now, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has a pocket-sized, white-bound pamphlet filled with his words of wisdom.
"Don't be attracted to easy paths because the paths that make your feet bleed are the only way to *get ahead in life.’
Earlier this year, the Iraqi Information Ministry *brought out ``Saddam Hussein:
Great Lessons, Commandments to Strugglers, the Patient and Holy Warriors.’
’ Most Iraqis were already familiar with the free pamphlet’s contents, 57 quotations drawn from speeches made by Saddam, including one in 2000 marking the 12th anniversary of the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
Since 2000, selections from the 57 commandments have been painted on school walls, carved on statues, printed in Iraqi newspapers, splashed across huge billboards, framed and placed on the walls in government offices _ all of which are controlled by the state, Saddam’s Baath party or Saddam’s son Odai.
The Muslim call to prayer is broadcast on state television in Iraq, and after every call _ five times daily _ a few of the commandments are read.
Saddam’s commandments cover all aspects of life.
He advises against making decisions in anger or humiliating an enemy after defeating him.
He calls for doing good, depending on brains as well as *brawn, ruling fairly, planning well, keeping people’s secrets and learning from others’ mistakes.
At Baghdad’s Al-Quds Elementary School, the commandments are painted in black and red on the walls of the entrance and in the classrooms.
Seven-year-old Ilaf Marwan raised her hand, then stood and recited confidently: ``Keep your eyes on your enemy and be faster than him.’
If Saddam is seeking advice as the current standoff regarding the U.N. weapons inspection intensifies, he might turn to page 11 of his pamphlet: ``Don't provoke a snake unless you have the intention and power to cut off its head.’
But contrary to critics like the New York Times
They're almost always a necessary, and usually belated response to dramatic change.
So it was at General Motors, which began downsizing after years of losing market share to Japanese automakers.
So it is at Sears, which has shed 50,000 people during the 1990s, as more and more of its customers have migrated to new competitors like Wal-Mart.
Indeed, the telecom industry is as good an example as any of the kind of profound change the American economy is currently undergoing.
There is globalization at work, as equipment that was once routinely made in the U.S. is now manufactured in places like Malaysia.
and the cataclysmic effect of deregulation, which will clearly transform this thing we call telecommunications in ways we can't even imagine right now.
Back in the old Ma Bell days, for instance, when AT&T was the telecommunications industry, it employed a little more than 950,000 people.
Today, AT&T employs roughly 300,000.
Yet the industry still employs around 950,000.
In other words, industrywide there has been virtually no job loss despite AT&T's downsizing.
thanks to the same economic forces that are causing AT&T to lay off workers right now.
They also complain that Wall Street
And they're right on both counts.
As for the first charge, the sad fact is that corporate America's inability
to soften the blow for that 55-year-old out-of-work middle manager is its biggest failure.

NEW YORK (AP) _ The union representing New York subway and bus workers suspended its deadline to shut down the nation’s largest mass transit system early Monday and reported progress in talks to avert a strike.
``We have made sufficient progress to stop the clock,’’ Transport Workers Union secretary-treasurer Ed Watt said.
The union’s 34,000 workers had been poised to strike if they did not receive a new contract giving them raises and changing work rules they called demeaning.
Union chief Roger Toussaint and top Metropolitan Transportation Authority negotiator Gary Dellaverson continued their intense talks at a midtown Manhattan hotel.
Watt said the two sides had made progress primarily in noneconomic areas.
But another union leader, John Moore, said the MTA had yet to address the issue of a wage increase _ potentially a significant obstacle to a settlement.
``Believe me, we feel bad for everybody out there,’’ said token booth clerk Patrick Jarvine, who was working late Sunday at the Times Square station.
``All we want to do is pay the bills.
That's all we want, and that's not too much to ask.’
Mayor Michael Bloomberg was pleased that negotiations would continue and hoped that a strike would be averted, spokesman Ed Skyler said.
Earlier Sunday, Bloomberg warned New Yorkers to plan for a strike and declared ``we are all in this together.’
George Pataki rejected demands that he intervene in negotiations.
``There is no person capable of riding in on a white horse with a bag of money to resolve this contract,’’ Pataki said.
He and Bloomberg spoke to reporters as the city’s emergency command center *went into operation *in anticipation of a strike.
Minutes later, Toussaint said all major contract issues still needed to be resolved.
But he did not *rule out a *last-minute settlement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Instead, Albert Dunlap, the former Scott Paper CEO and corporate America's unofficial spokesman on the issue, goes on Nightline and, to his eternal shame, labels as "socialism" Labor Secretary's proposal to give tax breaks to companies that avoid layoffs.
Whether or not the secretary's idea has merit, at least he's trying.
We point out the warning signs and investigate which industries are ripe for the next round of restructuring.
We follow a handful of career AT&T employees who have lost their jobs.
But throughout, we hope you'll be able to keep in mind that there is a larger picture here
It may not feel that way when you're in a downsizing company, but that is history's lesson.
transformation as we moved from a rural economy to an urban one.
We've been through the Depression, when the economy seemed moribund, and since then through a world war, when the economy was completely geared to war production.
We've watched the rise of the giant corporation, a development (speaking of ironies) that was not considered particularly healthy at the time.
Always, there have been winners and losers during such times of change, and the losers did not deserve their fate any more than today's unemployed middle manager does.
Yet in the end, we've always managed to adapt to the economic forces around us.
Yes, the old contract between company and employee is dead.
But eventually some new ethos will replace those values and will be as widely accepted
and as taken for granted
"I have a friend who works at a Silicon Valley company that is in deep trouble and is about to go through its second round of layoffs.
In better times, it was one of those places that threw beer blasts every Friday, gave its workers paid sabbaticals, and had a no-layoffs policy.
The company broke that policy about two years ago, and my friend remembers vividly how bad it was
"It completely changed the culture of the company.
We felt as if all the values we had believed in were thrown out the window.
Morale was just terrible;
people would hover in little groups to trade gossip about who was going to get laid off.

That was the most infuriating part of all."

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The strike against President Hugo Chavez’s rule began *strangling Venezuela's critical oil industry as thousands of opposition demonstrators noisily marched to a key symbol of the president’s revolution.
The strike _ which marks its 17th day on Wednesday _ has reduced Venezuela's oil output from nearly 3 million to 400,000 barrels per day, sending the world price of crude oil above $30 a barrel and depriving Venezuela of $50 million daily in export income.
The strike has cut Venezuela's oil exports to the United States _ Venezuelan oil normally accounts for 10 percent of U.S. oil imports.
Chavez has sent soldiers to striking oil facilities *to little effect, and Venezuela’s 13-tanker shipping fleet lay at anchor, its crews having joined the strike.
While the lifeblood of the nation’s economy slowed to a trickle, thousands of Chavez opponents marched toward the tomb of independence hero Simon Bolivar in downtown Caracas.
Tuesday was the 172nd anniversary of the death of Bolivar, who is revered by Chavez.
But the leftist president's opponents said they also *venerate Bolivar.
Hundreds of Chavez supporters, many wearing red headbands and waving red flags symbolizing Chavez’s leftist rule, awaited the opposition demonstrators at the tomb, ready to battle them in the streets as they have in recent days.
``We are defending Chavez,’’ said Heide Carolina Ruiz, an 18-year-old high school student.
She said she wasn't concerned that the Chavez supporters outside the tomb were far outnumbered.
Amid fears that violence might erupt, march leaders decided to halt the demonstration a couple of blocks from the tomb.
Then, 30 demonstrators were chosen to enter the building housing the bronze tomb through a side door and under police guard.

NEW YORK (AP) _ A civic group concerned with rebuilding lower Manhattan said Thursday that while the new designs for the World Trade Center site were inspiring, the process for deciding what will be built there is flawed.
``It was a great deal of form without any relationship to the function or the process,’’ said Ron Shiffman, a professor of architecture at the Pratt Institute.
Shiffman and others at the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown’s news conference said it was difficult to judge the plans presented Wednesday by seven teams of architects without knowing how much commercial space will be built at the trade center site _ and who is deciding that.
Beverly Willis, co-founder of a community group called Rebuild Downtown Our Town, said great architecture requires a great client.
``Do we have a great client?’
``I don't know who the client is.
George Pataki controls key appointments to the boards of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which has been charged with redeveloping it.
The two agencies, which together will choose a final plan by Jan. 31, instructed the architects who unveiled their designs Wednesday to plan for 6.5 million to 10 million square feet of office space on the 16-acre site.
The teams of architects from around the world offered a *dazzling array of designs, several of which included towers that would be the tallest buildings in the world.
The architects were not required to provide cost estimates with their presentations, but several of them said Thursday that their plans were flexible enough to be feasible whether there is a demand for 10 million square feet of office space or not.
Frederic Schwartz, a member of the THINK team, which offered three plans, said all the plans _ including a World Cultural Center *consisting of twin lattice-work towers _ are defined by their cultural and public space and could be built with or without their accompanying office buildings.
Rebuilding officials had said earlier that the final plan might incorporate aspects of several of the designs.
But Louis Tomson, president of the development corporation, said Thursday that something based on one of the nine plans will be built.
``I'm *floored by the response of these architects.’
I am delighted to be here to participate in this conference.
And I want to commend all of you, especially those of you who have come great distances, for helping to enrich the dialogue about current affairs among our countries and around the world.
This conference takes place at a historic time.
As we approach a new century, we also find ourselves on the frontier of a new world.
It is a world undergoing profound change.
We have watched as dictatorships and controlled economies have given way to democracy and free markets in country after country.
We have watched old divisions and hatreds recede or vanish.
And we have watched new opportunities for peace and prosperity unfold.
At the same time, we have watched change generate new challenges and intensify old ones.
The challenge of poverty, the challenge of shrinking resources and accelerated global competition.
The challenge of peaceful coexistence in the face of ethnic, religious, cultural and political differences.
And most of all, the challenge of putting people first, of including all citizens
men and women, rich and poor, people of all races and creeds
Today, too many nations waste precious resources on building and acquiring weapons of mass destruction, on staging wars and doing violence to basic human rights, instead of investing in their people.
Too often natural resources are destroyed and human ones exploited through irresponsible social behavior.
And too much time is spent in naked pursuit of power instead of working for peace and prosperity.

During my trip to South Asia, I saw example after example of women struggling to overcome poverty, illiteracy, inadequate health care and longstanding forms of discrimination.
I saw poor and illiterate women who had organized around their capacity to borrow and save money, and were beginning to lift themselves and their families out of acute poverty.
I saw women who had acquired skills to make crafts they could sell for profit.
I saw women insisting that their daughters be given the same opportunities for schooling as their sons.
Development experts tell us that where women lack the tools of opportunity, children tend to be less educated and less well-nourished.
Families tend to be larger and poorer.
Where women remain illiterate, we find that democratic institutions are more fragile and the environment less well-managed.
We have seen how the education of girls and women in parts of Asia and South America has lifted whole regions out of poverty.
We are learning around the world, and relearning here at home, that where women prosper, countries prosper.

has raised a question of grammar with serious implications for transgender people _ should the slain teen who lived as a girl be referred to as he or she?
News media, including The Associated Press, initially used the masculine pronoun.
Transgender activists saw the masculine pronoun as disrespectful _ saying it was clear that Araujo, who adopted the name Gwen after singer Gwen Stefani of the alternative rock group No Doubt, would have wanted to be referred to as a girl.
Others argued that allowing people to essentially self-declare their gender without undergoing a physical change is too subjective an approach to grammar.
After gathering more information from Araujo’s family, The AP decided to switch to the feminine pronoun when referring to the slain teenager from Newark, California.
The AP stylebook doesn't have an entry for ``transgender,’’ but does address the issue in part under ``sex changes:
``Use the pronoun preferred by the individuals who have acquired the physical characteristics (by hormone therapy, body modification, or surgery) of the opposite sex and present themselves in a way that does not *correspond with their sex *at birth.
If that preference is not expressed, use the pronoun consistent with the way the individuals live publicly.’
Araujo presented herself consistently as female _ wearing women’s clothing, makeup and long hair.
Araujo also intended to have sex-change surgery, according to her mother, Sylvia Guerrero, who had promised the teen she would file a name-change petition after that was accomplished.
``He was going to be a `she’ and so we can go by `she’ out of respect to her,’’ Guerrero told The AP.
Switching the habit of a lifetime has been tough for Araujo’s mother.
Although Guerrero tried hard to use ``Gwen’’ when they were out in public _ partly for her child’s safety _ she says she sometimes *slipped up, much to her teen’s *chagrin.
``It's not that I'm disrespecting you.
I respect you very much,’’ she remembers telling the teen.
Economic theory suggests that better human capital is an important source of growth.
Measuring it is devilishly difficult.
Investing in people is a popular political goal in rich and poor countries alike.
Rich-country politicians talk of "skill deficits" and the need to improve training;
in poorer countries, the emphasis is on better health and general education.
that is the health, education and skills of the workforce.
According to modern growth theories, the accumulation of human as well as physical capital is a powerful engine of economic growth.
But to gauge the effects of improved human capital, economists need to be able to measure it.
Unfortunately, this is far from simple.
Early attempts to measure its contribution to human capital made use of literacy rates.
In practice this is unsatisfactory.
The definition of literacy is subjective.
More important, the test captures only a basic level of education, ignoring the differences among literate people, some of whom are much better educated than others.
Another way of measuring the quantity of education is to use school enrollment ratios.
The main difficulty with this is that such ratios measure future, rather than present, human capital.
Today's schoolchildren will not be part of the productive labor force until far into the future.
The best attempt at measuring education across countries to date has been made by Robert Barro, an economist at Harvard University, and Lee Jong-Wha from Korea University.
In 1993 they published a comparison of educational attainment ratios for 129 countries between 1960 and 1985.
This calculated the proportion of men and women over 25 who had completed different levels of schooling (ie, none;
Although their results are widely used by economists as a measure of the educational component of human capital, they still leave some things to be desired.
One snag is the varying quality of education:
Moreover, even if educational quality could be accurately measured in these ways, the results would tell you only so much.
people who spent their school days studying classical Greek may have less productive human capital than those who studied computer science.
One way of overcoming these difficulties is to measure human capital by looking at wages.
In a recent paper, Casey Mulligan from the University of Chicago and Xavier Sala-i-Martin from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona tried to calculate an index of human capital based on labor incomes.
The idea is that the amount of human capital a person possesses should be reflected in pay.
Although this wage-based approach to measurement avoids some of the pitfalls that come from equating levels of education directly with human capital, it creates others.
For a start, the approach depends on having detailed information both about wages and schooling.
Messrs Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin calculated their index for the United States, where statistics are available in abundance.
It would be extremely difficult to replicate this approach in many other countries.
More crucially, the authors assume that labor markets function perfectly and that higher wages are based only on changes in human capital.
Even in the United States this is a dubious assumption.
Plainly, both approaches to measurement have their drawbacks.
Which is best will depend largely upon what countries economists are studying.
Where statistics are fragile or labor markets heavily distorted, the best approach is probably to try to improve measurement of education.
As with much in economics, the importance of human capital is easier to prove in theory than to measure.

VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II celebrated Christmas Eve Mass early Wednesday against the backdrop of a possible war against Iraq _ a war to which the Vatican is voicing increasing opposition.
Peter’s Basilica decorated with red poinsettias, a frail John Paul presided over Midnight Mass, *ushering in one of the most joyous Christian holidays amid mounting tensions between Washington and Baghdad.
``While the clouds of war lengthen, the minds and hearts of men in all continents are drawn to Christmas,’’ the newspaper wrote in a front-page article.
In recent days, top Vatican officials have said a ``preventive’’ war against Iraq had no legal justification and could spark an anti-Christian campaign in the Muslim world.
Despite the shadow cast by the specter of war, Christmas festivities were well under way at the Vatican on Christmas Eve, with the traditional unveiling of the life-sized Nativity scene in St. Peter’s Square, depicting the birth of Jesus in a Bethlehem manger.
Bagpipes played and children’s choirs sang on the warm winter’s night as visitors marveled at the *creche and twinkling Croatian Christmas tree that stood tall next to the piazza’s obelisk.
After nightfall, John Paul went to his studio window above the piazza and lit a candle, a silent vigil for peace that has been a hallmark of his 24-year papacy.
The pope later emerged for Midnight Mass, looking tired but resplendent in gold-trimmed white *vestments.
The 82-year-old pope suffers from the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and has trouble walking.
As hymns rang out in the marble basilica, 12 children from nine countries and dressed in traditional costumes presented wreaths to the church altar as John Paul looked on smiling.
In his *homily, the pope recalled the image of the baby Jesus in the manger, saying he was ``born for a humanity searching for freedom and peace.’

cried Sumner Redstone of Viacom, and Disney's Eisner agreed.
On the other side of the great divide, Rupert Murdoch of News Corp.
The debate becomes moot with Disney's epic deal:
But the conglomeration of Disney or Time Warner is not like that of ITT, which combines property insurance with antilock brakes and casinos.
Disney's merger with Cap Cities unites entertainment production and distribution operations that complement each other like oil and vinegar.
By contrast, the Westinghouse-CBS combination merely piles two broadcasters on top of each other.
Hollywood studios and TV networks are natural partners.
The Federal Communications Commission cleaved the two businesses apart in the 1970s with arcane regulations known as the financial interest/syndication rules.
Fin/syn is scheduled to lapse this fall, making deals like Disney's permissible again.
So long as fin/syn governed their behavior, entertainment companies had to choose between content and distribution.
Content hawks like Eisner argued that people pay for entertainment, not distribution;
no one wants to see a lousy movie or program, regardless of where it's shown.
The counterargument was equally convincing;
even the best programming will die unless it can reach its audiences.
In theory, the much-discussed convergence of computing, telecommunications, information, and entertainment creates a hierarchy of value.
But reality is more complicated than that.
Movies cost an average of $51 million each to make and market, and Hollywood churns out a couple hundred of them each year.
Yet 20 top pictures typically consume roughly 40% of total box office.
The odds are no better in TV production.
It's an asset play, not a cash flow play."
After building up great libraries of copyrighted movies and shows, production companies usually make up for lean years by selling out to a new owner for a fabulous price.
Every major studio but Disney has done that more than once.
But the leading content companies are getting almost too big to buy, making expansion into distribution a more attractive alternative.
ABC, NBC, Fox, and CBS still reach mass audiences with an efficiency unmatched by cable TV, movie theaters, videocassettes, or anything else.
That's true despite the growing popularity of entertainment alternatives, which have stolen 40% of the prime-time audience from networks.
The scarcity of mass distribution systems is what has magnified the economic value of networks.
In a decade or two, when telephone, cable, and satellite companies may offer 500 channels of mass distribution to every home, the networks' present advantage will shift to marketers with brand names viewers trust.
But a lot of money will be made and lost between now and then.
And when that day comes, Disney's shareholders will not be sorry to possess such familiar trademarks as ABC and ESPN.
ORDZHONIKIDZEVSKAYA, Russia (AP) _ Faced with the possible closure of the camp where he lives along with thousands of other Chechen refugees, Dzhabrail Galuyev says he would rather die than leave.
``Even if soldiers come in tanks and forcefully throw people out of their tents, even then I won't leave, I'll die here.
In that case, somebody would know about my death,’’ he said.
``There in Chechnya, I could simply disappear.’
He worried that his two sons would be seized by Russian troops during the loathed ``*mopping up’’ operations conducted in Chechen villages during the hunt for suspected rebels.
Civilians complain of wide abuses in these operations, saying innocent young men are taken away and never seen again, others summarily executed or beaten.
Like Galuyev, tens of thousands of Chechens are afraid to return to their homeland, where air strikes, artillery barrages and rebel attacks *break out daily, but are under pressure to leave their camps.
One camp was closed in early December, and human rights groups say authorities have told residents of other camps that their gas and electricity will be cut off and have even threatened to frame them for crimes if they don’ leave.
``Declarations by Russian officials that refugees’ return to Chechnya is completely voluntary is simply not true,’’ said Anna Neistat, head of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch.
``These insistent attempts to return people to a conflict zone are absolutely incompatible with Russia’s obligations under international law.’
The United Nations says about 20,000 people live in the tent camps, and another 90,000 stay with relatives or in makeshift shelters in Ingushetia.
At Galuyev’s camp, Bella, in the Ingushetia region next to Chechnya, the population has fallen by a third in recent months to about 4,000 amid threats it will soon close.
``Two weeks ago, about 12 to 15 soldiers, all officers, came here. They told the people it would be better for them to go away now when they could be helped with their move ... than when the gas and electricity is *cut off,’’ said refugee Anya Kosenko, 24.
``The soldiers said the decision to close the camp had already been made and the choice would be whether you would freeze to death in the cold _ or move,’’ she said.
One New York City resident said it was all about self-respect.

The men, gathered in a focus group conducted by FORTUNE, could be remarkably compassionate about the subject, but generally they regard midlife crises as vaguely embarrassing thing that other people occasionally have.
"Midlife crisis is a label you put on other people doing bizarre behavior.
But you never anticipate that you will do it."
But none of them concede that their midlife musings and second-guessing ever actually escalated into a crisis.
And none of them report having voluntarily changed careers, spouses, or hometowns as a result of any navel-gazing.
Frankly, these men appeared trapped, in their perception, by the burden of being men, and envious of the freedom available to many professional women.
Their self-image as breadwinners seems to have snuffed out any serious consideration of chucking everything for a new career or lifestyle.
Besides, says Peter, a benefits consultant, "Most men are scared to change.
They're afraid of making a decision."
Professional women in the workplace have it rough in many ways, but are freer than men to pull up stakes and try something completely different.
True, they have to put up with lower wages, leering bosses, the pressure of bearing and raising children, and the isolation of being almost alone in a male world.
But "a woman who is not the primary wage earner has the option of staying home," says one.
That is human, not female, nature, they agree:
Women, they say, are more likely to have crises because they have different "clocks" that force them to make important decisions at different times than men.
Other men in the group feel that women become very concerned about their appearance when they turn 40.
When women worry that their attractiveness is ending, they worry that their career is ending too, and quit.
"Men see themselves as having 20 more years."
When a full-fledged midlife crisis comes along, though, nearly all agree that a woman is likely to handle it much better than a man.
"Men buy Porches, disappear to Florida, shack up with chippies, and come back six weeks later.
They get involved socially;
they join a bridge club."
How would their wives react if these men announced they were having a midlife crisis?
Every reaction imaginable has been predicted.
Dave figures his wife would be concerned and compassionate.
Al's ex-wife would have hired a private detective, figuring he was about to have an affair, he jokes.

Rapid advances in the computer and telecommunications technologies have drawn valuable business information, as well as personal communications, out into the open.
Businesses need to protect telephone conversations and electronic messages from competitors, industrial spies, and private investigators.
Consumers using computer networks to send personal mail, file tax reports, or shop from home with a credit card also need confidentiality.
But as security becomes a growing concern in this age of ever higher technology, a possible solution has emerged
cheap, easy to use, and virtually unbreakable encryption.
The problem with encryption is that it can help shield lawbreakers as well as law-abiding citizens.
U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies contend that if virtually unbreakable codes become widely available, their efforts to protect the public from criminal elements will be paralyzed.
So the agencies have developed a technology known as "clipper chip" as a way to neutralize strong encryption.
David Galernter, associate professor of computer science at Yale University, says the clipper has become the focus of a yearlong public debate.
"More people in the technology and scientific community oppose it out of fear of government intrusion into privacy.
They regard that kind of fear of government as prudent.
I would regard it as paranoid.
But that's where the difference of opinion comes in."
In this "Focus" report, Neil Lavan assesses the necessity to balance the individual's right to privacy with society's need to combat crime in the information age.
Cryptography, the science of sending secret messages, has been used by governments, diplomats and military commanders since antiquity.
It has always worked by means of keys.
An original message was encrypted by the sender into jibberish and decrypted by a receiver using the same method, or key.
Problems arose with making the key known to both parties and then protecting it from third parties.
Modern day encryption began in the mid-1970s when two computer scientists at Stanford University split the cryptographic key.
The split-key system shields telephone communications from eavesdroppers and provides a secure electronic identification for contracts and financial transactions.
In this system, every user has two keys a public one and a private one.
Whatever is scrambled by the public key can only be unscrambled by the private key.
If somebody uses your public key to send you an encoded message, you alone can decode it because you alone have the private key.
A potential third party would not be able to crack the code.
Enter the clipper chip.
Created by scientists at the U.S. National Security Agency, the clipper chip would let users encode telephone, computer transmissions, and other communications devices while allowing law enforcement agencies to decode them.
Also known as an "escrowed encryption system", clipper is, in effect, an additional key held by the government in escrow.
Steven Walker, a former top National Security Agency cryptographer, says opponents want to know why law-abiding citizens should give the federal government the key to their private communications.
"It is not clear to me and to a lot of others, that the government necessarily does have or should have the right to listen in to any private communications that you and I might wish to have."
Computer scientist David Galertner argues that although one may buy a telephone or a computer that comes factory-equipped with the clipper chip, that doesn't limit an individual's ability to run any kind of encryption he or she wants.
"Well, you can unplug the clipper chip and throw it away.
More likely you can run any other kind of coding scheme on top of clipper.
David Johnson practices computer law in Washington, D.C.
He is also president of Lexus Council Connect, an on-line communication service for lawyers.
He says government officials hope the clipper will become the standard and will be widely used around the world because they worry that an increasingly sophisticated encryption technology could weaken the legal process.
But, he says, he's not sure clipper is the answer.
"They have never quite explained how it can be that a voluntary standard, like they propose, will really either be used by the people they're most interested in listening in to, which is unlikely, or ultimately be widespread, because in fact, the likelihood is that many people most concerned about security for very good reasons will distrust a standard that is designed, in part, to be intercepted."

LOS ANGELES (AFP) _ Hollywood's top movie studios are poised to post a record year with around $9.2 billion in ticket receipts despite a U.S. economic slump and rampant movie piracy, industry sources said Monday.
``There is every indication that 2002 will be a bumper year for the major studios which have had a number of big blockbusters under their belts,'' said Paul Degarabedian of box office trackers Exhibitor Relations.
Final 2002 box office figures for the top studios were *due out* later this week, but early projections indicated that $9.2 billion worth of tickets were sold, up by about 10 percent over last year's record.
The 2001 box office total of $8.35 billion had set a new all-time record.
Despite jitters over an impending war with Iraq, a dismal US Christmas retail season and growing piracy, movie attendance was expected to grow by at least five percent, with higher ticket prices accounting for the remaining rise in revenue.
Some 1.5 billion movie tickets were sold during the year, as new hits such as the musical ``Chicago,'' Jack Nicholson's new film ``About Schmidt'' and ``Gangs of New York'' open.
A Los Angeles Times study showed that more Americans went to the cinema this year than at any time since 1959, with escapism from recession and the threat of terrorism proving a major boon to the box office.
``Even though people have many more choices as far as leisure activities are concerned, the movies still offers a great form of escape,'' Dergarabedian said.
Mega-blockbusters of 2002 that helped fill studio coffers included a quiver of spin-offs of established characters as well as a bevy of sequels to previous hit movies that the studios were keen to cash in on.
The year's five top grossers were ``Spider-Man,'' ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' ``Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones,'' ``Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' and the animated feature ``Monsters, Inc.''

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Deadly space laser aside, some South Koreans are finding another aspect of the latest James Bond flick hard to swallow _ its depiction of neighboring North Korea as a diabolically evil regime and the whole Korean peninsula as a backward underling to Western saviors.
``Die Another Day’’ attracted crowds at its Seoul premiere on New Year’s Eve.
But since then many South Koreans are siding with the communist North in panning the film, despite the nuclear standoff that has recently boosted tensions between the countries.
The latest 007 has even spurred a budding boycott movement.
``I don't want to see a movie where North Korea is depicted as a menace to peace on the Korean peninsula and the United States is depicted as a hero that resolves the crisis,’’ said Park Jin-young, a 22-year-old university student waiting in line for a different picture Friday at a Seoul cinema.
In the movie, Bond, allied with South Korean operatives, is sent to intercept a crazed North Korean officer, Colonel Moon, who is planning an invasion of South Korea and then Japan.
Bond is eventually captured, imprisoned and tortured in communist North Korea.
Later, North Korea uses a satellite-based laser beam to burn a swath through the Demilitarized Zone separating the Koreas.
The movie, starring Pierce Brosnan as agent 007, also depicts a U.S. intelligence official ordering the mobilization of the South Korean army and an outdated scene of Koreans using a cow to till fields.
Bond also has sex in a Buddhist temple.
On Friday, a South Korean civic group announced plans to launch a boycott campaign at some 140 cinemas nationwide where the film is shown.
The complaints nearly echo those North Korea made before the film’s debut.
The MGM hit proves that the United States is ``the headquarters that spreads abnormality, degeneration, violence and ... corrupt sex culture,’’ said North Korea’s Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland.
The committee is a communist party organ dealing mainly with relations with South Korea.
Its statement was carried last month by the North’s official news agency, KCNA.
North Korea’s media has also called on the United States to stop screening the film, saying the 20th James Bond feature slanders the isolated communist state.
Relations between the United States and North Korea chilled last year after U.S. President George W. Bush branded North Korea part of the ``axis of evil.’
Inter-Korean exchanges also have slowed since North Korea took steps last month to reactivate a nuclear program that experts say could build atomic bombs.
But when it comes to the latest British secret service spy tale, the two Koreas have formed a bond of a different sort.
And mutual outrage has only springboarded off rising anti-U.S. sentiment in South Korea following the recent acquittals in U.S. military courts of U.S. soldiers whose armored vehicle hit and killed two Korean girls.
Underlining the backlash was the lionization of popular South Korean actor Cha In-pyo, who was initially approached for the role of maniacal Colonel Moon.
He refused the part, complaining it belittled his countrymen.
Despite calls for a boycott, however, many are still lining up for the film’s action-packed thrills _ and sometimes out of plain curiosity over all the fuss.
``I want to see the movie just to see what the critics are complaining about,’’ a 27-year-old Lee Se-young said after slapping down 7,000 won ($5.30) for a ticket.
(AP) _ At 17 years old, Ben Harris estimates he smokes a pack of cigarettes every two or three days.
Harris, who began smoking when he was 9, doubts he'll quit anytime soon _ not even if officials in this borough of 2,000 near Reading enact a proposal to prohibit anyone under 18 from smoking outdoors.
``I've tried quitting and it's a lot harder than people think,’’ Harris said. ``A lot of people I know aren't happy about this.’
Borough Council President Randy Gartner said police officers aren't happy they have no authority to cite teens smoking around town, especially in the summer.
``The police chief and I were discussing the fact that kids could not legally buy cigarettes in Pennsylvania, but we could see a lot of kids getting off the school bus and lighting up and coming to the playground and lighting up,’’ Gartner said.
The council was originally expected to vote Monday on the proposed ordinance, which requires violators to pay a $50 fine.
But the council now has decided to hold off on a decision while its attorney researches whether the proposal conflicts with a state law that pre-empts local anti-tobacco ordinances, Gartner said.
Under Pennsylvania law, teens face penalties only for buying tobacco products _ including up to 75 hours’ community services, a $250 fine, and suspension of their driver’s licenses for up to 30 days, state Health Department spokesman Richard McGarvey said.
If the ordinance is approved, Robesonia would likely become the first municipality in the state to impose such a ban, according to the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors.
According to the American Lung Association, 33 states prohibit minors from possessing tobacco products.
Flemington became the first New Jersey community to prosecute teens for smoking in 1995.
Penalties range from a verbal warning for the first violation to a fine of up to $300 for five infractions.
The department has cited hundreds of teens since the law took effect, but no one has incurred more than three violations, said Cpl.
Chris Foley, Flemington’s juvenile officer.
“I'm not getting as many calls as I used to get when it first took effect, meaning that the program works,’’ Foley said.
Ironically, national and statewide anti-smoking groups have opposed laws that seek to prosecute minors for smoking.
They have argued that such efforts divert attention from retailers who sell cigarettes to minors, which they view as the real source of the problem.
“Our concern has been that the tobacco industry has been willing to accept efforts to go after kids as an alternative to going after the retailers,’’ said Eric Lindblom, manager for policy research for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, D.C.

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A presidential decree making Christmas _ which falls on Tuesday on Egypt’s Coptic Christian calendar _ a national holiday is focusing attention on relations between Christians and Muslims in this overwhelmingly Islamic country.
It is the first time a Christian holiday has been officially recognized in modern Egypt.
In the past, only Copts, as Egyptian Christians are known, got Christmas *off*, while the rest of Egypt worked as usual.
Several Islamic holidays have long been national holidays.
Reaction by some Muslims illustrates the sometimes uneasy relationship between the two *faiths*, according to Copts who say their identity as Egyptians and their contributions are not adequately recognized.
A statement posted on Islammemo, a Web site devoted to conservative Islamic comment, said President Hosni Mubarak made Christmas a holiday because of U.S. pressure to prove Egypt was democratic and respected *minorities’* rights.
The Muslim Brotherhood expressed surprise that the whole country was given the day off when, according to prominent Brotherhood member Essam el-Erian, only students had complained about occasionally having to take exams on Christmas.
``It is so strange that the regime is giving the people one more day off, while most government employees are not hard workers,’’ el-Erian said.
Christmas became Egypt's 18th national holiday.
Copts have a long history in Egypt _ tradition says St. Mark brought Christianity to Egypt just a few years after the death of Christ.
Copts were once so dominant here that their name is the ancient name for all Egyptians.
Now they are estimated at just 10 percent of Egypt’s 68 million people.
Copts *survived* Roman persecution and Arab conquest, and today are generally free to worship in Egypt.
But they complain of tensions with the Muslim majority and say they face discrimination, particularly in the job market.
At times, they face violence.

SEOUL (AP) _ The robust South Korean economy traditionally (shrugs off) (flare-ups) with rival North Korea such as a deadly naval clash last summer.
But atomic weapons are a different matter.
North Korea's nuclear programs have now been (branded) this year's biggest (hazard) to the South's economy by the nation's central bank chief.
And the recent tensions are blamed as a contributor to everything from a tumbling stock market to (hollowed-out) foreign investment.
The economy is (far from) the (downward spiral) it took during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, but economists warn that its rebound could be undercut if Pyongyang adds to the two (atom bombs) it is believed to already possess.
``The nuclear issue is a burden on the economy,'' said Lee Sung-kwon, chief economist at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities in Seoul.
Clashes with the North are not unheard of on the Korean peninsula, which has been divided since 1945 and fought a three-year war in the 1950s, although they were more common in decades past.
Last June, a naval shootout killed six South Korean sailors, and a year earlier, communist and South Korean troops (fired shots) across the (Demilitarized Zone) separating the two sides.
Financial markets usually react with no more than a ripple.
But since revelations in October that North Korea has a secret atomic weapons project, even a small confrontation along the border now carries nuclear overtones.
Just last week, Bank of Korea chief Park Seung called it the biggest peril to the country's economy.
If the threat of war were to escalate too far, the economy could shrink this year instead of growing at 5.7 percent as forecast by the central bank, he said.
Any disruption to peace would be a ``significant blow'' to foreign investment as well as exports and domestic consumption, Park said.

HONOLULU (AP) _ A century ago, Ronald Moon's grandfathers arrived here from Korea facing a future of working in Hawaii's sugar cane fields.
Like others in those first waves of Korean immigrants to America, they carried (little more than) their culture, their values and a strong work ethic, qualities that descendants like Moon, the chief justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court, credit for helping shape their lives today.
``They were true pioneers, and it took a great deal of courage, motivation and sacrifices to come here,'' Moon said. ``I (have no reservations in saying that) (if not for) their teachings and values, I certainly would not be here.''
On Monday, exactly 100 years after the first documented group of Korean immigrants set foot in Hawaii, those first Korean immigrants to America will be honored by the Centennial Committee of Korean Immigration to the United States.
Among the 1,600 people expected to attend the gala are diver Sammy Lee, the first Asian American to win an Olympic gold medal, and retired Col.
Kim Young-oak, recipient of 19 military medals and the first Asian American officer to command an American infantry battalion in combat.
``(There's no question) the Koreans in Hawaii, and in many parts of the United States where they have settled, have done a great deal,'' Moon said. ``When we speak about 100 years here, I think the Koreans (have gone very far).''
The first Korean immigrants to America arrived on the morning of Jan.

In schools, teachers tell students Americans are ``two-legged wolves'' and the United States is a ``hotbed of all evils swarming with beggars.''
From kindergarten children to People's Army troops, hatred toward Americans is part of life in the impoverished, Stalinist state that gets much of its international aid from the country it despises.
The isolated regime's bellicose rhetoric reached a new pitch in the past week, when North Korea escalated its nuclear standoff with Washington, warning of a ``Third World War,'' ``a sea of fire'' and a ``holy war'' against the United States.
``It's hardly new to me,'' says Lee Jae-gun, a South Korean fisherman who was kidnapped to North Korea and lived there 30 years until escaping in 2000. ``It's a daily fodder in North Korea.
Defectors from North Korea describe the country as an Orwellian place built on three pillars:
a personality cult surrounding leader Kim Jong-il, Stalinism and hatred of anything American.

The sultry jazz musical ``Chicago'' won the Golden Globe for best musical-comedy Sunday while ``The Hours'' was honored as best film drama.
Dramatic performance honors went to Jack Nicholson for playing a depressed retiree in ``About Schmidt'' and Nicole Kidman for her role as suicidal writer Virginia Woolf in ``The Hours.''
``I don't know whether to be happy or ashamed because I thought we made a comedy,'' Nicholson said.
The tragicomic ``About Schmidt” features him as an aging man searching for meaning at the end of his life.
Kidman, who disguised her face with prosthetics for the role, said she was just glad ``The Hours'' was made into a film.
``It was a tricky movie in terms of the subject matter,'' she said.
``Chicago'' co-stars Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere won for best musical-comedy acting, and Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper received supporting performer honors for the loopy screenwriting comedy ``Adaptation.''
Martin Scorsese received the best director for the Civil War era immigrant saga ``Gangs of New York,'' a film he had wanted to make for decades that, once completed, was delayed for more than a year by Miramax Films.
``Maybe `dream come true' is a cliche because cliches are true.

CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ For most of their modern history, Iraqis have been little more than spectators as foreign occupiers, then a monarchy created by Britain, and finally a series of homegrown strongmen played politics as a game of intrigue and assassination, massacre and war.
Iraqis must overcome that bloody past if they are to have a say in their future.
The United States, threatening war to topple President Saddam Hussein because it believes he has weapons of mass destruction, says it wants his regime replaced by democracy.
Iraqi exiles have (drawn up) ambitious plans, but are weakened by ethnic, religious and political divisions.
These will make it difficult for the more than 22 million Iraqis to unite behind any new vision for the country.
Saddam is just one in a long line of Sunni Muslims who have dominated Iraqi politics and the military despite being roughly one-third of the population.
Any Sunni reluctance to (yield) their status (to) the majority Shiites could (stand in the way of) democracy.
Hamid al-Bayati, London representative of the Iran-based Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a conservative Shiite group long opposed to Saddam, believes that despite its past, Iraq will eventually fall in line with what he sees as a global trend.
``The whole world is moving toward democracy,'' al-Bayati said. We are Islamists and we believe that democracy is the only way to ensure freedom.''

(AP)_ Fossil hunters in China have discovered what may be one of the weirdest prehistoric species ever seen _ a four-winged dinosaur that apparently glided from tree to tree.
The 128-million-year-old animal _ called Microraptor gui, in honor of Chinese paleontologist Gu Zhiwei _ was about 21/2 feet (77cm) long and had two sets of feathered wings, with one set on its forelimbs and the other on its hind legs.
Exactly where the creature fits into the evolution of birds and dinosaurs is not clear.
But researchers speculated that it developed around the same time as or even later than the first two-wing, birdlike dinosaur, Archaeopteryx, which is believed to have flown by actually flapping its wings.
Paleontologists were intrigued by the discovery.
They have seen gliding dinosaurs before, but never one with feathers.
And they have never seen a four-winged dinosaur before.
"It would be a total oddity _ the weirdest creature in the world of dinosaurs and birds," said Luis Chiappe, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County who did not participate in the dig.
Scientists said the fossils _ discovered in the Chinese province of Liaoning, northeast of Beijing, at a site that has yielded several important specimens in recent years _ revive a debate between two theories of how dinosaurs might have evolved into birds.
One theory holds that some of these apparent bird ancestors learned to flap their wings to power flight while they were gliding from tree to tree.
The other theory suggests they learned to fly by increasing their running speed with their wings and taking off from the ground.
The latest find tends to support the gliding-in-trees theory.
Details of the fossils appear in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
Paleontologist Xing Xu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences described six fossils with leg feathers arranged in a pattern similar to wing feathers in modern birds.
"They are long and some have asymmetrical vanes like flight feathers," Xu said.
The feathered legs amount to rear wings, Xu said.
He speculated they could have represented an intermediate stage of development before the emergence of true flight powered by flapping the wings.
Or, the feathered legs could have been an evolutionary dead end, other researchers said.

DIAMOND MOUNTAIN, North Korea (AP) _ Chun Kyong-ok, a North Korean ``environmental monitor,'' had a ready answer to why the United States does not attack the isolated communist state while ``(poking its nose into) every corner of Iraq, even its president's palace.''
``That's because of our mighty military power,'' Chun said matter-of-factly.
Hiking up the Diamond Mountain valley in North Korea is a (sojourn) to a storied natural site that has inspired generations of Korean scribes with its beauty.
But it's also a visit to a place left behind in a Cold War era, where the ideas of a generation ago are everywhere, on granite slabs and on the lips of communist (minders).
The minders posted along the trekking route up the mountain's Nine Dragons Valley are called ``environmental monitors,'' but are really part tour guides, part propagandists.
Chun, a woman in her early 20s with (a dab of) lipstick and crimped (hair pulled into a bun), said U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell ``were all war maniacs and that expecting them to love peace is like telling a wolf to give up bloody meat and live on vegetables.''
The men and women _ wearing clean, padded anoraks and makeup, luxuries in this impoverished, totalitarian state _ mingle freely among the tourists traveling on a cruise ship that has taken a detour around the sealed border between the Koreas.
The trip is run by the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai, which gives visitors _ mostly South Koreans _ a rare view at the fabled Diamond Mountain in the southeast corner of North Korea.
In return for opening up to tourists, the Stalinist state gets badly needed hard currency.
On the trip, the Northerners were eager to learn how their communist regime and leader Kim Jong-il were viewed by South Koreans and the United States amid high tensions over Pyongyang's recent moves to reactivate its nuclear programs.
``Everybody is eager to know more about the South Koreans,'' Chun said.
She and other minders shoveled snow and had no problem chatting freely with the Southern visitors, who trudged up a path cut through thigh-high snow wearing crampons and bright windbreakers.
``If you have to choose between the Americans and the fellow Koreans, what will you do?'' Hong Young-il, a 28-year-old North Korean, asked a South Korean.
The Southern tourists usually (shy away from) political debate.
Hyundai, which has been running the tour since 1998, asks them not to say anything that might offend North Koreans.
The Northerners seemed carefully educated in international issues concerning their government.
They repeated official lines, but on occasion their comments threw rare glimpses into the North Korean thinking.
Asked whether he considered the Americans a ``sworn enemy'' as North Korea's official media often claim, Hong said, ``That was so in old days.''
``We are now ready to talk with the United States if they recognize us and treat us as an equal partner,'' he said. ``The problem is the United States wants to subjugate us.''
Before their historic summit in 2000 thawed relations, the two Koreas had vilified each other for decades.
Hur Bok-nam, a 26-year-old North Korean, urged the two Koreas to ``live up to their compatriotic spirit and join forces to fight foreign forces'' _ a theme all North Korean minders stressed.
``One finger doesn't do much, but five fingers make a fist that can punch,'' he said.
Hur looked disappointed but listened to the notion that most South Koreans want 37,000 U.S. troops to stay in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, as a deterrent against North Korea and for regional security even after the two Koreas reunify. ``You get tired of a guest who stays more than three days.
How can they have U.S. troops for over 50 years?'' Chun, the female guide, said she hoped heavy snow this winter heralded a ``plentiful harvest'' later in the year in the hunger-stricken country, which is dependent on outside aid to avert famine.
She also hoped that ``cooperation and reconciliation with the South will thrive to resolve our problem in the North.''
Diamond Mountain also serves as a billboard for the personality cult that has dominated the isolated country for half a century.
Verses and slogans cut into granite slabs extol the late President Kim Il-sung, father of Kim Jong-il.
The trekking route was dotted with monuments celebrating the ``historic'' visit by the senior Kim in 1947.
One monument was built at a spot where Kim's ``faithful'' wife, Kim Jong-suk, had to give up the rest of her hike and head down the valley to ``prepare lunch for the Great Leader.''
The trekking ended at a pagoda that commands a panoramic view of snowcapped peaks glinting in the sun and the frozen Nine Dragons Waterfall.

WASHINGTON (AFP) _ The United States and the rest of the world will not be (``blackmailed'') by North Korea's drive for nuclear weapons, President George W. Bush said Tuesday in his State of the Union address.
``On the Korean peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation,'' Bush said.
``Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to (keep) North Korea (from) gain(ing) nuclear weapons.
We now know that the regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along.
''And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions.
``America and the world will not be blackmailed,'' Bush said, noting that Washington was working with South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.
But he warned Pyongyang that ``nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship.''
``The North Korean regime will find respect in the world, and revival for its people, only when it (turns away from) its nuclear ambitions,'' Bush said, in remarks on North Korea that were much more restrained than some of his other statements over the last year.
Bush had previously offered to reactivate a ``bold approach'' to North Korea, once it ends the twin nuclear programs which the United States said sparked the crisis.
But administration officials say they will not ``negotiate'' with the Stalinist state, and will only talk with it about how it can verifiably (stand down) the nuclear programs.
Bush did not call on the United Nations Security Council to (take up the issue), though other lower-level U.S. officials have called for such a move.
Pyongyang has warned that it will see any sanctions imposed by the council as a declaration of war.
The crisis was triggered last October when U.S. envoy James Kelly confronted the Stalinist state during a visit to Pyongyang with U.S. claims that North Korea had launched an enriched uranium program in violation with a 1994 anti-nuclear deal with Washington.
Despite North Korea's denials, the United States suspended fuel aid to Pyongyang, which responded late last year by reactivating the mothballed Yongbyon plutonium producing nuclear complex, and expelling U.N. monitors.
Even as Bush spoke however, there was a new blow for hopes to and end to the crisis.
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's envoy Lim Dong-Won left Pyongyang Wednesday after failing to meet Kim Jong-il, officials said.
``After arriving in Seoul at 12:40 pm (0340 GMT), the envoy will brief President Kim on the outcome of his visit to North Korea,'' a South Korean official said.
Before going to Pyongyang, Lim said he would try to receive a direct response from Kim Jong-il to Seoul's proposal for a peaceful solution to the North Korean nuclear issue.

(AP) _ High over Texas and just short of home, space shuttle Columbia fell to pieces, raining debris over hundreds of miles of countryside.
Saturday's catastrophe occurred 39 miles (63 kilometers) above the Earth, in the last 16 minutes of the 16-day mission as the spaceship re-entered the atmosphere and glided in for a landing in Florida.
The day echoed one almost exactly 17 years before, when the Challenger space shuttle exploded.
``The Columbia is lost,'' said President George W. Bush, after telephoning the families of the astronauts to console them.
``The same creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today,'' Bush said. ``The crew of the shuttle Columbia did not return safely to Earth but we can pray they are safely home.''
The search for the cause began immediately.
possible damage to Columbia's protective thermal tiles on the left wing from a flying piece of debris during liftoff on Jan.
NASA appointed an independent commission to investigate.
The agency said the first indication of trouble Saturday was the loss of temperature sensors in the left wing's hydraulic system.
The spacecraft had just re-entered the atmosphere and had reached the point at which it (was subjected to) the highest temperatures.
NASA officials said they suspected the wing was damaged on liftoff, but felt there was no reason for concern.
A piece of insulating foam on its external fuel tank came off shortly after liftoff and was believed to have hit the left wing of the shuttle.
Leroy Cain, the lead flight director in Mission Control, assured reporters Friday that engineers had concluded any damage was considered minor and posed no safety hazard.
``As we look at that now (in hindsight) ... we can't discount that there might be a connection,'' shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said Saturday.
``But we have to caution you and ourselves that we can't rush to judgment on it because there are a lot of things in this business that look like (the smoking gun) but turn out not even to be close.''
Authorities said there was no indication of terrorism; at 207,135 feet (62,140 meters) and traveling at 12,500 mph (20,112 kph), 18 times the speed of sound, the shuttle was out of range of any surface-to-air missile.
Security was extraordinarily tight on this mission because Ramon, Israel's first astronaut, was among the crew members.
It was a relatively inexperienced crew;
only three _ Husband, Anderson and Indian-born Chawla _ had flown before.
The others were rookies, including Ramon, the 48-year-old Israeli Air Force colonel.
A former fighter pilot who survived two wars, he carried into space a small pencil drawing titled ``Moon Landscape'' by Peter Ginz, a 14-year-old Jewish boy killed at Auschwitz.
``The state of Israel and its citizens are as one at this difficult time,'' Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office said in a statement.
Television footage showed a bright light followed by white smoke plumes streaking diagonally across the sky.
``We saw it coming across the sky real bright and shiny and all in one piece.
We thought it was the sun shining off an airplane,'' said Doug Ruby, who was driving along a Texas highway.
Pieces of the spacecraft were found in several east Texas counties and in Louisiana.
A piece of debris the size of a compact car fell into Toledo Bend Reservoir on the Texas-Louisiana line, said Sabine County Sheriff Tom Maddox.
In Nacogdoches, 135 miles (217 kilometers) northeast of Houston, a National Guardsman stood watch over a steel rod with silver bolts.
People streamed up to take photos of the debris.
The Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice to airmen because the National Weather Service radar picked up a debris cloud about 95 miles (153 kilometers) long and 13 to 22 miles (21 to 35 kilometers) wide over Lake Charles, Louisiana.
The Army's 1st Cavalry Division sent a helicopter search-and-rescue task force from Fort Hood, Texas.
NASA also asked members of the public to help in its search for debris, but warned people not to touch the pieces because they might be contaminated with toxic propellants.
The flight was the 113th in the shuttle program's 22 years and the 28th flight for Columbia, NASA oldest shuttle which was built in 1981 at a cost of about $1 billion.
The horrific end of shuttle mission STS-107 was a devastating blow to the nation's space program;
the Challenger explosion led to a 2-year moratorium on launches, and Saturday's accident could bring construction of the international space station to a standstill.
The shuttle delivers components of the space station to be installed;
it also carries crews to and from the station.
The three astronauts now on board the station could return to Earth at a moment's notice via a Russian vehicle attached to the space station.
Six shuttle flights had been planned for 2003 _ five of them to the space station.
The next was scheduled for March 1.
``We trust the prayers of the nation will be with them and with their families.
A more courageous group of people you could not have hoped to know,'' said NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe.
Columbia had been scheduled to land at Kennedy Space Center at 9:16 a.m.
Dittemore said ``there was no indication of any impending threats to the vehicle.''
Then there was a loss of data from temperature sensors on the left wing, followed by a loss of data from tire pressure indicators on the left main landing gear
``Columbia, Houston, we see your tire pressure messages and we did not copy your last.''
Columbia's commander, Rick Husband, calmly responds:
For several seconds, the transmission goes silent.
In 42 years of U.S. human spaceflight, there had never been an accident during the descent to Earth or landing.
The American flag next to Mission Control's countdown clock was lowered to half-staff.
O'Keefe met with the astronauts' families, who had been waiting at the landing site for the shuttle's return.
Six of the seven astronauts were married, and five had children.
Clark's brother, Daniel Salton, monitored Columbia's return from his Milwaukee home.
It was his sister's first shuttle flight.
``I'm just so glad she got to get up to space and got to see it because that had been a dream for a long time,'' he said.
The shuttle is essentially a glider during the hour-long decent from orbit toward the landing strip.
It is covered by about 20,000 thermal tiles to protect against temperatures as high as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,648 degrees Celsius).
Columbia's crew had completed 80-plus scientific research experiments during their time in orbit.
In Washington, at least three government investigations will probe the Columbia disaster, and NASA’s shuttle program director vowed to find the answers so America can continue sending people into space.
The investigations will review all the information NASA collected as the spaceship began its descent Saturday morning, then started breaking up more than 200,000 feet (60,000 meters) over Texas.
SEOUL (AP) _ South Korea opened a road across its heavily militarized border with North Korea on Wednesday, the first such connection between the countries in more than five decades.
The South also said it wanted to (take further steps) toward reconciliation despite the communist state's defiance (over) its nuclear program.
Meanwhile in Washington, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage gave senators the U.S. administration's strongest assurance to date that Washington intends to have a direct dialogue with North Korea.
While hoping for a peaceful solution to the standoff over the North's nuclear ambitions, U.S. ally South Korea fears that the tension might escalate into an armed conflict on the volatile peninsula.
In a conciliatory move on Wednesday, a group of 107 South Korean tourism officials and business people traveled to a scenic mountain resort in the North on a recently built cross-border road.
The 10 buses moved slowly along the narrow (dirt road) to the northern side as snow fell.
South Korea's Hyundai business group started a money-losing cruise to the Diamond Mountain resort in 1998.
The company hopes the cheaper overland trip will attract more South Korean tourists.
The road is the first overland route linking the two Koreas since they were divided in 1945.
The 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not in a peace treaty, and the two countries are (technically) still at war.
Their border is the world's most heavily fortified.
The road was one of several cooperation projects agreed upon at a historic inter-Korean summit in 2000.
Wednesday's trip was hoped (to pave the way for) organized tours by South Korean tourists.
2 leader said that while Seoul would not tolerate the North's alleged atomic weapons program, it wanted to move ahead with reconciliation efforts.
"We can never tolerate North Korea's nuclear weapons development, which is a threat to our national security and world peace, but tension should not be allowed to keep rising on the Korean Peninsula," Prime Minister Kim Suk-soo said in a speech to the National Assembly.
South Korea, the prime minister said, intends to expand several joint projects before outgoing President Kim Dae-jung steps down on Feb.
Those projects include cross-border railways, tourism and an industrial park.
In Washington on Tuesday, Armitage testified before a congressional hearing: "Of course we're going to have direct talks with the North Koreans."
It was unclear whether his comments marked a change in U.S. policy.
Washington has previously demanded that North Korea give up its nuclear ambitions before talks.
Meanwhile, the top U.S. military commander in South Korea stressed that the militaries of the United States and South Korea must cooperate to cope with the nuclear standoff.
"The combined forces of the ROK-US alliance are highly trained, well-equipped and superbly led," Gen. Leon LaPorte said, adding the South Koreans would be consulted about any possible U.S.
The ROK, or the Republic of Korea, is South Korea's official name.
The United States keeps 37,000 soldiers in South Korea.
U.S. officials in Washington say Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is considering sending an aircraft carrier to (the waters) off the Korean Peninsula and adding bombers in Guam.
The moves are intended (to deter) the North (from) provocations during any U.S. war with Iraq, Pentagon officials said.
In a dispatch monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency, the North's official news agency, KCNA, said the reported U.S. reinforcements were "a serious development that can only be seen on the eve of war," and that "our people and military will react with strong self-defense measures."
North Korea's media routinely churn out anti-U.S. invective, but it has become more frequent and intense since the nuclear dispute erupted in October, when U.S. officials said the North had admitted having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 pact.
As punishment, the United States and its allies suspended oil shipments to North Korea in December.
The North then took steps to restart a nuclear reactor, expelled U.N. monitors and withdrew from a global nuclear arms control treaty.

But University of California scientists who switched birds' beaks through a little egg (tinkering) had more than (avian oddity) in mind:
The experiment uncovered some of the key cellular players in bird evolution, and may even lead to better understanding of what causes facial birth defects such as cleft palate.
``It connects back to some of the earliest roots of evolutionary thought, but also connects to very real issues in human medicine,'' molecular evolutionist Michael Braun at Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History said after reading the new research.
Birds' amazing variety of beak styles (is integral to) the study of evolution.
One of Charles Darwin's most famous observations during his 1835 visit to (the Galapagos Islands) was that (finches) were subtly different _ including their beak size and type _ depending on where they lived on the chain of pristine, volcanic islands.
His analysis of such differences later led to his theory of evolution through (natural selection).
But just what genes and cells drive those differences remained mysterious.
Beaks all derive from similar-looking tissues in very early bird embryos, said Jill Helms, an orthopedics researcher at UC San Francisco.
To find out what makes them turn out dramatically different, she and colleague Richard Schneider picked two birds with unmistakable beaks _ ducks and quails _ and tried to get them to grow each other's.
They took 36-hour-old duck and quail embryos from an incubator and drilled small holes in the eggs encasing them.
Using the tiniest of needles, Schneider sucked out the cells that seemed (to give rise to) beaks, called (neural crest cells), from duck embryos and replaced them with neural crest cells from quail embryos, and vice versa.
Taping over the egg hole, researchers let the eggs incubate until they were about 11 days old, halfway to hatching but just large enough to tell what the still-forming birds' beaks looked like.
(Letting them survive to hatch with beaks they didn't know how to use would have been unethical, Helms explained.)
Call the result ``qucks'' and ``duails:
'' The ducks grew pointy little quail beaks and the quails grew that distinctive flat, wide duck bill, the researchers report in Friday's edition of the journal Science.
That means neural crest cells carry species-specific programming for beak growth, Paul Trainor of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City said in an accompanying Science review.
The transplanted neural crest cells also altered how the bird's natural tissues and even genes reacted in the presence of the foreign beak, slightly modifying some surrounding facial features and speeding some gene action, Trainor noted.
Together, that makes the cells crucial players in beak evolution.
It's an important study, narrowing down the specific pathway that produces birds' amazing variety of beaks, agreed the Smithsonian's Braun.
But seeing how these cells direct the development of surrounding tissue has implications far beyond birds, he said.
Indeed, understanding what causes a beak to develop the way it does could (shed light on) human (craniofacial) development, Helms said.
If people harbor an equivalent to the birds' powerful neural crest cells, perhaps surgeons one day could correct a cleft palate before a baby was born with a transplant of the right mouth-growing cells, she said.
Helms equates her experiment to eavesdropping on a conversation between two tissues, as the transplanted cells altered the bird's natural development.
``Once you understand the nature of the dialogue between the tissues, then you can start to think about, when development goes awry, is there a way to correct it,'' Helms explained.
and the United States is in the thick of the debate.
It isn't even rich against poor.
SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP)_ Investigators are searching for evidence that a block of ice big enough to damage Columbia's wing may have formed on a waste water vent, a problem that plagued an earlier shuttle flight.
They also are looking closely at what may be two key pieces of Columbia debris _ a 2-foot (60-centimeter) piece of one wing, including an attached chunk of thermal tiles, and a 300-pound (135-kilogram) cover of a landing gear compartment, possibly the site.
16 launch, military radar detected an object moving rapidly away from the shuttle.
NASA said it is unknown what the object was, but the possibility that it could have been ice from a wastewater vent sent investigators back to a detailed search for evidence that the shuttle may have formed ice throughout its mission.
Hal Gehman, head of a board investigating the Columbia accident, said Sunday that the object detected near the shuttle could have come from the spacecraft itself and could be ice.
Space Command of the Air Force, which monitors objects in space, is providing data on the object to the investigators.
The waste water vent, which is under the shuttle cabin, in front of the left wing, is used to expel into space both urine and surplus water generated from the shuttle's fuel cell power system.
Usually the water shoots out into the cold vacuum of space as a spray of crystals, but on at least one shuttle mission, in 1984, the water formed a basketball-sized chunk of ice on the lip of the vent.
At the time, NASA engineers were so concerned the ice could damage the shuttle wing during re-entry that they ordered the astronauts aboard Discovery to use the shuttle's robot arm to break off the ice ball.
That heavy robot arm, which wasn't necessary for Columbia's 16-day science mission, was left off so more experiments could be added, and the waste water vent could not be seen from the cabin by the seven astronauts.
NASA spokesman Kyle Herring said it's possible ice could have formed and not been detected, even though heaters were installed on the wastewater dump valve after the 1984 mission.
When Columbia fired its rockets to drop out of orbit, it could have sent any accumulated ice slamming into the wing where other data suggests there was severe damage to the thermal protection tiles.
The theory is unproven and is only one of a number of scenarios being probed by engineers.
``We're going to let the Columbia accident board guide us in terms of their findings about what caused this accident.''

TOKYO (AP) _ With the economy (in the doldrums) for years and unemployment at a record high, Japanese are (racking up) debts, (falling prey to) (loan sharks) and declaring bankruptcy (by the thousands).
Individual bankruptcies soared fivefold in the last five years to more than 214,600 in 2002, up 34 percent from the previous year, according to the Japanese Supreme Court.
And experts say the nation’s culture of shame about debts and overall ignorance about the law are a big part of the problem.
Kanamori and other experts say the ballooning problem of (deadbeat) borrowers has produced a booming business of illegal lenders, some linked with gangsters, who charge outrageous interest rates _ such as 1,800 percent a year, according to police _ and hound borrowers with threats (to wring) payments (out of) them.
Loan sharks are a growing menace in other parts of economically struggling Asia as well.
Malaysia’s Parliament is considering tough new laws against illegal moneylenders following a spate of suicides by hopelessly indebted people.
Japanese police say 446 people were arrested last year on charges of operating illegal lenders, but the arrests are believed to be a just small portion of the rampant crime.
The Tokyo police have set up a special team (to crack down on)``yami-kinyu’’ or ``(racket) lenders.’
In most cases, the victims are average, honest, hardworking people.
A ``salaryman’’ worker or a housewife, they usually start out borrowing a small amount of money to keep up with mortgage payments or bills.
But once they miss a payment, they get ensnared in the trap of owing more and end up turning to other dubious lenders _ only to find themselves deeper in debt.
Lenders can legally charge up to 29 percent interest in Japan, but many (exploit) people’s ignorance about the law and charge far higher interest, such as 50 percent over 10 days.
In Japan, family ties tend to be strong and the nightmare of bad debts can spread to relatives, who often co-sign loans.
A 34-year-old Tokyo consultant, who asked that his name be withheld because he is worried about losing his job, had to declare bankruptcy when he found out that he had co-signed more than 120 million yen (US$1 million) bank loans for his father’s machinery business, which eventually (went bust).

WASHINGTON (AP) _ NASA released what it called the most vivid (snapshot) of the infant universe ever taken, capturing such stunning detail that it may be one of the most significant scientific achievements of recent years.
Evidence that answers long-standing questions about the age, composition and evolution of the universe was gathered by scientists using NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy (Probe) (WMAP), a satellite orbiting 1 million miles from Earth, during a 12-month observation of the entire sky.
``This picture of the early universe is a gold mine,'' Charles Bennett, WMAP principal investigator at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration released the picture Tuesday. ``The patterns in the picture tell us all kinds of things about the universe.''
One key finding in the data is that the first generation of stars to shine in the universe ignited much earlier than previously thought _ only 200 million years after the Big Bang, the theoretical explanation for the explosion that (gave birth to) the universe.
The image shows the ``afterglow'' of the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave background (radio rays).
Also, the new portrait pegs the age of the universe at 13.7 billion years old, with a small 1 percent margin of error.
``We have a map of the earliest light of the universe that is complete, and it is (stunning) to look at,'' Princeton physicist Lyman Page said.
``The light seen today as the cosmic microwave radio rays has traveled for more than 13 billion years to reach us,'' NASA said in a statement. ``Within this light are (infinitesimal) patterns that mark the seeds of what later grew into clusters of galaxies and the vast structure we see all around us.''
Patterns in the afterglow of the Big Bang are frozen (in place) only 380,000 years after the Big Bang, NASA said. At that time, the universe was filled with hot gas heated to 2,725 degrees Kelvin (2,541 Celsius).
The probe’s goal was to establish a map of the universe, making precision measurements to one millionth of a Kelvin degree of infinitesimal fluctuations of temperature, known as anisotropy, observed in the universe about 400,000 years after the Big Bang.
WMAP is the result of a partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University.

PYONGYANG (AFP) _ North Koreans believe they teeter (on the brink of) war, and a strong hatred of Americans invigorates them as they prepare mentally for a possible conflict. ``I think the U.S. army might attack.
They have openly said so,'' said Kim Mi-gyong, a guide at the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in the North Korean capital Pyongyang which commemorates the 1950-53 Korean War.
With the four-month-old nuclear crisis on the peninsula showing no signs of (abating), North Koreans are (bracing themselves) to face an (adversary) they believe is worse than Hitler's troops.
``The (atrocities committed) by the U.S. side during the war were worse than those committed by the German soldiers in World War II,'' said 76-year-old Kim Thae-hwa, who commanded 700 soldiers in North Korea's last battle with the United States half-a-century ago. ``They dropped germ bombs that afflicted people for years.''
In the museum, nauseating collections of photos show alleged U.S. war crimes including beheadings, skinnings and torchings.
One million North Korean visitors are exposed to these images of brutality every year as they are taken on tours through the museum's 82 rooms.
``I hate the Americans very much but I'm not afraid of them,'' said Kim, the guide, a young woman whose tender exterior (belies) her harsh words.
``If the U.S. attacks again, we will annihilate the U.S. army, all of them, wipe them off the face of the earth.
Then the North and the South can live together peacefully.''
North Korea has accused the United States of setting in motion invasion plans by launching a massive arms build-up.
Late Wednesday the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, referred the nuclear crisis to the U.N. Security Council, which raises the possibility of sanctions.
Pyongyang has said (sanctions) would (amount to) a declaration of war.
Kim's remarks mirror official propaganda which says the U.S. military presence in South Korea is all that (stands in the way of) reunification of the long divided country.
``We don't hate the American people but we hate the U.S. army as long as they occupy South Korea,'' said Kim the war veteran.
A long-standing aversion to the U.S. enemy is very much alive among ordinary North Koreans and the Pyongyang government, under Kim Jong-il, knows how to keep the hatred burning by constant reminders of the U.S. threat.
Political cartoons in the official newspapers resemble Soviet caricatures in the darkest days of the Cold War, with American GIs depicted in dehumanized robotic form and U.S. politicians portrayed as beer-bellied and hysteric.
The Pueblo, an American spy ship that North Korea captured in 1968, is docked on the banks of Pyongyang's Taedong River and receives hundreds of visitors every day.
``After seeing this ship I have come to hate the United States,'' said Chong Il-chul, a Pyongyang worker with curly hair and a stern look who was among a group touring the ship.
``The Americans are our worst enemy.
They have been causing misfortune for our nation for a long time and they are still doing it today.''
Animosity towards the U.S. appears to extend to all levels of society, even affecting the well-educated and much-traveled who know the outside world.
One Pyongyang resident who said his grandfather was executed by U.S. soldiers in the early stages of the Korean War had little love for Americans when he went abroad to study.

SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ For three generations, Bashir Khan's family has helped guard the splendid, but (endangered), forests in India's northern state of Jammu-Kashmir _ the Himalayan region where Pakistan, Muslim insurgents and India have waged a bitter battle for decades.
Khan and the hundreds of other unarmed forest guards are not fighters. For the past 13 years, they have been patrolling the mountain woodlands to protect the forest itself and the wildlife struggling to survive in this battleground.
Since 1990, 72 government forest department officers have been killed.
``The first (fallout) of militancy in the state was easy access to weapons.
``Hundreds of hectares (acres) of forest land have been destroyed since 1990,'' he said.
India and Pakistan, which both claim all of Kashmir, have fought two wars over the territory since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
About a dozen Islamic militant groups began fighting in 1989 to separate the Jammu-Kashmir region from India and join it to neighboring Pakistan or create an independent state.
There is almost daily gunfire across the cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
The Islamic insurgency, the Indian security force actions to subdue it, and a population that is growing despite 61,000 deaths in the conflict since 1989 have all (taken a toll) on the beautiful landscape.
Set in the Himalayas at 5,600 feet (1,706 meters) above sea level, Kashmir is a green, saucer-shaped valley full of fruit orchards and surrounded by snowy mountain ranges.
About a hundred lakes dot its highlands and plains.
Glacier-fed streams flow through the forests, hillsides and over grasslands covered with wildflowers.
Environmentalists say the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir has lost more than 150 square kilometers (59 square miles) out of 20,000 square kilometers (7,722 square miles) of forest cover since 1989.
Waterways have been polluted and wild animals have been killed.
The Kashmiri red deer or Hangul, the state animal, has been declared endangered by the World Wildlife Fund, and only 500 remain alive in protected areas.
Kashmir's snow leopards are killed for their skin, and by frightened villagers.
Ibex, Himalayan musk deer, the blue bull and migratory birds are also killed in the fighting and by hunters and smugglers.
Stripping the land of old growth forest leaves bare hillsides exposed to heavy rainfall.
The water rushes down the hills, eroding the loose soil and flowing into rivers and lakes, such as the mirror-like Dal Lake in central Srinagar, which is becoming overgrown with weeds and sludge.
``The Dachigam Forest is the (catchment area) for the springs and underground water channels that feed the Dal Lake,'' said Mian Javed, a senior forest official and wildlife warden.
``With heavy felling of trees in the catchment area, water levels of the lake were dangerously reduced.
Though 80 percent of smuggling has been curbed, there is still a lot to be done.''
In the few areas where patrols are possible, trees again cover entire mountainsides.
But Wadoo said that many regions are out of bounds for forest guards because they are close to border areas and security zones.
``My guards cannot patrol in the night because of stringent security in forest areas, but smugglers can smuggle their pack-mules on the same routes,'' he said.
The increase in human population _ despite daily deaths in the fighting _ has combined with overgrazing of livestock and lack of money for conservation and reforestation.
Deforestation and mismanagement of water resources have caused soil erosion, which is responsible for frequent flash floods in Jammu-Kashmir, Maqbool said.
Some lakes and rivers have become polluted, causing disease.
Environmental rejuvenation would take at least 25 years of continuous restoration efforts.
``It takes an hour to cut down a fully grown Kashmiri cedar but it takes over 30 years for one to grow to its full size,'' he said.
In 1996 the forest department vigorously recommenced reforestation in highly degraded areas, Wadoo said.
The department has reforested 57,100 hectares (141,000 acres), planting over 55 million trees.
People have also become a danger to the forest.
The social, political and economic turmoil has led to neglect of natural resources.
Most people who live in Kashmir's 20,000 square kilometer (7,722 square mile) forest area _ one-fifth of the Indian-controlled portion _ depend on agriculture or livestock breeding.
Since 1991, the population of Jammu-Kashmir state has increased 30 percent, and Forest Department officials say it has risen 20-22 percent in the protected areas.
``Clearing trees for farmland and increased grazing is a major forest-endangering practice,'' Wadoo said.
In Kashmir, six head of cattle graze in two hectares (five acres) of forest land, although the law permits only one.
Most pastureland is next to forests.
As villages expand, they push the orchards and grazing land into the forest.
Wadoo's forest management program calls for village committees to take responsibility for forest preservation, with technical assistance and funds from his department.
``Natural regeneration is the best way for forests to grow.
But ... these regions should be nurtured and protected.
Unless that happens, even effects of nature's healing could be lost,'' Wadoo said.
In the early 1990s, the Sind Valley forests were felled and the mountainsides were bare.
But the conservation efforts since 1996 bolstered the natural process, resulting in an ``almost complete cover around the Sind Valley,'' Wadoo said.
The forestry budget of 100 million rupees (US$2 million) a year is not enough, though, he said.
The Norwegian government recently promised Jammu-Kashmir's government 1.5 billion rupees (US$31.25 million) for a reforestation project, development of grassland and introduction of modern agricultural projects, state finance minister M.H.
Forest officials say that generous funding could alleviate half their troubles, if it comes.
``We don't know when we will get that money.
Up to now we have only been promised 1 million rupees (US$20,880) for a pilot reforestation project,'' Wadoo said.
``People may have lost their concern for forests because there are more pressing agendas, but we have to go on harping until they realize,'' he added.

HONG KONG (AP) _ Eleven-year-old Nicky Lee (doesn't mince words) about the English language, (spewing out) a (tirade) in Cantonese.
``It's very difficult,'' says Nicky, who spends several hours a day studying English at school. ``I hate memorizing grammar, and teachers at my school are so boring.''
Then he sags (in relief), because he's getting a break from lessons at a private tutorial center where he comes in the afternoons for even more of the dreaded English.
Richard Hui, 9, takes another view:
Their dilemmas may (sum up) the state of language learning in Hong Kong, where business and government leaders worry that young people are falling into a linguistic (limbo).
Hong Kong youths appear to be (ending up) less than proficient in speaking English, the international (lingua franca) of business, and in writing Chinese, with its thousands of characters to learn.
To complicate matters, Hong Kong's dominant tongue is the Chinese dialect of Cantonese, which is vastly different from Mandarin, the national language of mainland China.
Officials want to see Mandarin more firmly established here, five years after Britain handed this former colony back to the motherland.
``People's standard of English _ and their standard of Chinese, too _ has been slipping appreciably over 20 or 25 years,” says Yang Ti-liang, who was chief justice during British colonial days but now is trying his hand as a volunteer English teacher at a youth center.
The 73-year-old retired judge says that in the old days, even the lowliest office workers had a reasonable command of English. Nowadays, employers have trouble finding employees with enough skill to even answer the phone.
Yang says even some people who can get by in English don't have a good grasp of it.
He argues, for example, that people used to do much better in picking Anglicized names for themselves, which Hong Kong Chinese have long done.
He cites a businessman who calls himself ``Star'' and a woman who named herself ``Polyesta,'' names he finds a bit too weird for the globalized mainstream.
``The situation is much more alarming than people are willing to accept,'' says Benjamin Tsou, professor of linguistics and Asian languages at City University of Hong Kong.
``Hong Kong cannot afford to let its English continue to slide if it wants to continue as a cosmopolitan, international city. As matters stand, there is that danger, and the government ought to act decisively to reverse the trend.''
The city's government is pushing for better English and Chinese skills and disputes some of the criticism.

SEOUL (AP) _ Seven subway officials were detained Monday by police pending issue of arrest warrants in the subway fire that killed at least 133 people last week in South Korea, authorities said.
Police applied to a court for warrants after apprehending the suspects, said Lt. Choi Woong-ju of the police department in Taegu, where the fire happened.
The seven are widely expected to face charges of criminal negligence.
There is no limit on how long the suspects can be detained after a warrant application, but judges usually respond to such requests within 24 hours.
Police are also seeking warrants for three other people, including two subway officials and the man accused of igniting the carton filled with gasoline that started the blaze, Choi said.
All three were in the hospital with injuries from the fire.
The fire quickly (engulfed) the six-car train and then spread to another train which (pulled into) the station a few minutes later.
The actions of train operators who allowed the second train to arrive are being investigated, and police said they will also (look into) suspicions that the subway corporation tried (to cover up) or destroy evidence of a possibly bungled response.
Most of the victims were passengers on the second train whose conductor allegedly fled without opening the doors, leaving victims trapped in the flames.
Police said that of the six cars in that train, the doors were open on only two of them.
Only 46 bodies have been positively identified.
Many of the victims were burned beyond recognition, and officials said they may need weeks, perhaps months, to identify them by DNA tests.
Critics said the tragedy revealed problems with the nation's emergency response system and a potential vulnerability to terrorism.
(Had the train been equipped with) (fire-resistant) seats and floor tiles, many said, it probably would not have (burst into) flames.
And an apparent lack of adequate emergency lighting left victims groping in the dark after the lights went out.

WASHINGTON (AFP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in an interview Monday that he has no plans (to comply with) a U.N. demand that he destroy his banned Al-Samoud 2 missiles.
Saddam flatly denied that even his most advanced al-Samoud missiles violate U.N. restrictions, indicating he does not intend to destroy them or pledge to destroy them as demanded by chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix.
``We do not have missiles that go beyond the (proscribed) (range),'' Saddam Hussein insisted in the CBS television interview, his first with a U.S. journalist in a decade.
President George W. Bush to join him in a live radio and television satellite (linkup) to debate the need for war before the world.
``I am ready,'' said the Iraqi President, ``to conduct a direct dialogue _ a debate _ with your president.
I will say what I want and he will say what he wants.''
``This will be an opportunity for him, if he's committed to war, this will be an opportunity to convince the world.''
``This is something proposed in earnest'' Saddam said, ``out of my respect for the people of the United States and my respect for the people of Iraq and the people of the world.
I call for this because war is not a joke.’
’ `` As leaders,'' said the Iraqi president to his U.S. counterpart, ``Why don't we use this opportunity?''
There can be no debating the need for Saddam Hussein to disarm,'' said White House spokesman Scott McClellan earlier.
Chief U.N. arms inspector Hans Blix has given Iraq until Saturday to begin destroying the missiles, which can carry a warhead of 300 kilograms (660 pounds), as well as component parts.
Blix's demand came after a panel of U.N. weapons experts concluded the Al-Samoud 2 missiles exceed the allowed range of 150 kilometers (93 miles).
``What is serious is Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the United Nations Security Council. And on the very day that Hans Blix said there can be no negotiations over the destruction of his Al-Samoud missiles, Saddam Hussein again refuses to even acknowledge that the missiles are (in violation of) the U.N. resolutions,'' said McClellan.
``It is, yet again, further evidence that Saddam Hussein has not and will not disarm,'' the spokesman said.
The comments came as the United States and its allies circulated a draft resolution widely seen as paving the way for military action.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations on Wednesday reduced its estimate of the (global) population in 2050 by 400 million, primarily because of the prolonged and worsening impact of the AIDS epidemic and lower than expected birth rates.
(At the dawn of the new Millennium), the U.N. Population Division forecast that 9.3 billion people would (inhabit) the Earth at mid-century but a new revision of the estimate projects a lower population of 8.9 billion.
About half the 400 million drop in the projected population is a result of an expected increase in the number of deaths, primarily from AIDS, the forecast said.
The other half is due to a reduction in the projected number of births, primarily as a result of lower expected (fertility rates) in the future.
``For the first time, the United Nations Population Division projects that future fertility levels in most developing countries will likely fall below 2.1 children per woman, the level needed to ensure the long-term replacement of the population, at some point in the 21st century,'' said the forecast.
By 2050, it projects that three out of four countries in less developed regions will have fertility levels below replacement levels.
The 2002 Revision,'' confirms key conclusions from previous revisions about population growth.
Despite expectations of lower fertility levels and increased death risks, global population is still expected to increase from 6.3 billion today to 8.9 billion in 2050, it said.
The Population Division warned, however, that the latest projections depend on ensuring that couples have access to family planning and that efforts to halt the current spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are successful.
If fertility in all countries remained at current levels, it said, ``the total population of the globe could more than double by 2050, reaching 12.8 billion.''
But based on the new estimates, the forecast predicts that the population of more developed regions, currently at 1.2 billion, will (change little) during the next 50 years.
Thirty-three countries are projected to be smaller at mid-century than today _ Japan losing 14 percent of its population, Italy 22 percent of its population, and Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Russia and Ukraine between 30 and 50 percent of their populations.
(By contrast) in less developed regions, the population is projected to rise steadily from 4.9 billion in 2000 to 7.7 billion in 2050, according to the forecast.
The populations of Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Somalia, Uganda and Yemen, are projected to quadruple because of expected annual growth rates of more than 2.5 percent between 2000 and 2050, it said.
In the most (populous) countries, large population increases are expected even if fertility levels are projected to be low.
Between 2000 and 2050, the forecast said eight countries are expected (to account for) half the world's projected population increase _ India, Pakistan, Nigeria, the United States, China, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Congo.
The 2002 Revision indicates a worsening of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (in terms of) disease, deaths and population loss.
In the current decade, 46 million people are expected to die of AIDS in the 53 most affected countries, ``and that figure is projected to ascend to 278 million by 2050,'' the forecast said.
The deeper reductions in fertility rates projected in the new forecast will result in the faster ageing of the population in developing countries, it said.
Globally, the number of people over 60 years old will nearly triple from 606 million in 2000 to nearly 1.9 billion by 2050, the forecast said.
``Whereas 6 of every 10 of those older persons live today in less developed regions, by 2050, 8 of every 10 will do so,'' it said.
One study found that vaccination not only protected day-care children against the flu but appeared to protect their non-vaccinated siblings as well, presumably because of reduced exposure to the bug at home.
who are known to be at increased risk of infections
During the 1996-97 flu season, half of 149 children at 10 day-care centers in San Diego were vaccinated.
Results showed that the vaccine was 45 percent effective.
Another study of healthy adult workers at one company also showed that administration of the vaccine resulted in fewer illnesses.
Carolyn Buxton Bridges, a medical epidemiologist at the influenza branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported on a flu-vaccine program involving healthy adult employees ages 18 to 64 at the Ford Motor Co.
During the 1997-98 and 1998-99 flu seasons, nearly 1,200 participants each year were given the flu shot.
Because the flu vaccine given in the first season did not match well with the influenza strains circulating at that time, vaccinated employees did not experience fewer illnesses than workers who were not vaccinated.
Overall, 1 percent of vaccinated workers got sick, compared with 10 percent of the unvaccinated group.
Yet the inoculation program did not result in an overall savings to the company because the expense of the vaccinations was greater than the savings in preventing disease and keeping employees on the job.
Flu shots are not generally recommended for healthy people in either of these age groups because they have a low risk of developing life-threatening illnesses.
And with the flu vaccine in shorter supply this year than before, doctors are emphasizing that the shots be offered first to the elderly and other high-risk individuals.

So ends a medical report detailing Josef Stalin's last four days, as he lay dying in his Moscow (dacha).
It is part of a new exhibit at Russia's federal archives, whose officials hope it will help dispel decades of speculation that the Soviet dictator (was done in) by a Kremlin intrigue.
If mysteries about Stalin's demise persist, they are dwarfed by the conflicting views and emotions that surround his life _ and his role in the troubled history of a country that seems unable to break his spell 50 years after his death.
``There may be no other figure in Russian history of the last century who has provoked such different evaluations, from fierce hatred to consecration,'' said historian Yuri Polyakov, a member of the prestigious Russian Academy of Sciences.
For some, Stalin was a giant who bore the Soviet Union on his shoulders to victory in World War II, hauled it onto the front line of the industrial age and kept ironclad order at home while turning the country into a superpower with (the clout) to make its Cold War foes shudder.
``He was the best _ as a chief, as a leader. He lifted the country out of the ruins,'' said Natalya Vekshina, 64, who took her grandson to a separate exhibit, across town, focusing on Stalin's cult of personality _ the propaganda that portrayed him simultaneously as a god and a good guy.
``We need a leader like him now,'' Vekshina said.
Larisa Tsvizhba, at the archive exhibit, disagreed.
She said Stalin left a ``sinister mark'' on the Soviet Union and (stunted) its growth by decimating a generation.
``When millions of people die for no apparent reason _ the best people _ what kind of progress can there be?''
Russian officials have said they believe more than 20 million people were victims of communist purges before Stalin's death.
More than 10 million are said to have died.
Like many of Stalin's ardent admirers, Vekshina is from a generation that mostly suffered from the Soviet collapse.
She lost her engineering job, while her scientist husband is ``a big man in his field _ but now he's impoverished.''
But it's not only the elderly who (yearn for) Stalin's strong hand.
``He is the symbol of a healthy nation,'' said Alexei Fedyakin, 27, a (political science) graduate student who came to see the ``Stalin: Man and Symbol'' exhibit and wrote a diatribe in the visitors' book complaining about material showing Stalin in a bad light.
Those items _ records of executions, and artwork depicting Stalin holding the keys to a prison cell stretching across the Soviet Union _ reflect (the backlash) that came in two waves, one soon after his death and another in the late 1980s, with Mikhail Gorbachev's (glasnost).
In 1956, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin's (cult of personality), and his body was removed from its place next to Lenin in the Red Square (mausoleum) in 1961.
But it was buried nearby, alongside the Kremlin wall, and much of the truth about Stalin's excesses did not emerge until the Gorbachev era.
The sharp criticism of Stalin that (held sway) as the Soviet Union collapsed waned along with the (euphoria) of Russians hoping for a swift, smooth transition to democracy.
Stalin's star has brightened for those angered by lawlessness, economic uncertainty and their country's decline on the world stage.
Oleg Orlov, head of (the human rights) organization Memorial, said that frustration helped fuel the rise of President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB colonel who has restored some Soviet-era symbols and has been careful in his criticism of Stalin.
``Putin arrived on this wave _ on promises of stability and pride for one's country as a great power, and of a restoration of order _ and a major part of this ideology was pride in the past,'' Orlov said.
According to poll results by the Public Opinion Foundation last week, 37 percent said Stalin did more good than bad for the country _ compared to 29 percent who believe the opposite.
The organization contacted 1,500 respondents across Russia on Feb.
No margin of error was given.
In the visitors' book at the ``Man and Symbol'' exhibit, one person mused:
``I wonder, will our country live to see the moment when Stalin is perceived as an ordinary person, instead of as either the devil incarnate or the Father of the Peoples?''
The power of Stalin's personality and the scale of the suffering that marked his rule suggest that's unlikely to happen anytime soon.
On one wall in the exhibit stands a large (diorama) presented to Stalin on his 70th birthday, in 1949.
Inside, a row of dolls marches in Red Square, bearing a banner reading ``Thank you, Comrade Stalin, for our happy childhood.''
Under glass in another room is a book listing victims of Stalin's terror.
Polyakov, the historian, said there is one thing he has never really figured out about Stalin:
why he killed so many people.
``There's no answer,'' he said.

TAIPEI (AP) _ Pipi's eyes bulge fiercely when strangers approach the Chihuahua dog in the (cramped) clothing store where her owner works.
But Pipi doesn't bark.
Her owner, Chen Sheng-hua, suspects the rescued (stray's) (vocal cords) (were snipped).
``When she opens her mouth, nothing comes out,'' Chen says.
Animal rights activists say they frequently find (mute) dogs that apparently (have been dumped) by illegal breeders, who are having trouble selling animals in Taiwan's slow economy.
In a crowded place like this island, where most people live in apartments or in densely populated towns, unlicensed breeders are tempted to cut dogs' vocal cords to keep them from disturbing neighbors and attracting the attention of authorities, the activists say.
``The mute dog problem is like the stray animal problem, a result of wrong policies,'' activist Shen Jung-chen says.
Animal rights groups say the authorities waited too long before (taking steps) aimed at (holding down) a big rise in the numbers of stray dogs, such as (neutering) dogs and registering pets.
Activists have also criticized the public for buying cute little dogs and then dumping them on the streets when they grow big and old.
Veterinarian Chen Chia-chun says it's extremely rare for dogs to be born mute.
He suspects Pipi lost her vocal cords in a new surgical procedure that doesn't leave a scar.
``In the past, operations to remove a dog's vocal cords left a mark on the outside of the animal's throat,'' the doctor says. ``But now vets go straight into its throat through the mouth and remove the vocal cords from the inside.''
The operation is not without risk, he adds.
The cutting away of the vocal cords leaves an animal with a higher risk of infection.
Chen says he was asked (by phone) to perform such an operation once, but (turned it down).
Sometimes people (pick up) strays to raise at home, but then neighbors complain about the noise, leaving the new owners with the choice of either dumping the dog on the street again or silencing it.
However, Shen, the animal rights activist, argues private breeders are responsible for nearly all cases rather than traditional pet owners.
Individuals begin breeding dogs at home for profit, Shen says.
But because they fear neighbors will complain to the police, the breeders have the animals' vocal cords cut.
If the illegal breeders think capture is near, they dump the animals in the streets, Shen says.
``Only about 30 out of 300 private dog breeders are registered,'' Shen says, adding that pushing for their compulsory registration is one of her group's priorities.
In an isolated valley south of Taipei, the air is thick with the smell of (feces) produced by about 850 dogs living in a shelter run by volunteers.
There are rows of cages, some sheltered by (corrugated) metal roofs.
Pairs of muddy dogs share each cage, and most of them begin barking as soon as they see visitors.
(Mutts) are mixed in with English sheepdogs, beagles, Dalmatians and other pure breeds.
One volunteer, Yang Hsiang, says that out of the 500 dogs she's responsible for, more than a dozen are mutes, including four that were picked up together.
There could be more but finding them is difficult because they're drowned out by the deafening barks of hundreds of dogs.
One of the mutes is Nana, a shepherd mix with long ears and long bushy tail.
She succeeds in uttering a sound, but it's only a hoarse croak, not the bark or yelp of a big healthy dog.
Yang is worried about the dogs because their numbers continue to multiply while donations are (dwindling).
Many Taiwanese (are reluctant) (to euthanize) dogs because it violates their Buddhist beliefs.
``The people who bring the dogs are also responsible for paying for the food,'' she says, ``but as Taiwan's economy has gone into decline, donations are drying up.''
The portents of this disarray were there from the start.
Expropriations and house demolitions proceeded inexorably through the Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu and Barak administrations, along with the expansion and multiplication of settlements, military occupation continuing and every tiny step taken toward Palestinian sovereignty stymied, delayed, canceled at Israel's will.
This method was politically and strategically absurd.
Occupied East Jerusalem was placed out of bounds by a bellicose Israeli campaign to decree the divided city off-limits to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and to claim it as Israel's "eternal, undivided capital."
The 4 million Palestinian refugees were told that they could forget about return or compensation.
With his own corrupt and repressive regime supported by both Israel's Mossad and the CIA, Yasir Arafat had to rely on U.S. mediation, even though the U.S. negotiating team was dominated by former Israeli lobby officials and a president who showed no understanding of the Arab-Islamic world.
Behind the peace process were two unchanging Israeli/American presuppositions, both of them derived from a startling incomprehension of reality.
Second, after seven years of steadily worsening economic and social conditions for Palestinians everywhere, Israeli and U.S. policy-makers persisted in trumpeting their successes, excluding the United Nations and other interested parties, bending the partisan media to their wills, distorting the actuality into ephemeral victories for "peace."
Isolated in the United Nations and unloved everywhere in the Arab world as Israel's unconditional champion, the United States and its lame-duck president have little to contribute.
Neither does the Arab and Israeli leadership, even though they are likely to cobble up another interim agreement.
The slaughter of Palestinian youths goes on while the U.S. officials back Israeli brutality or express disappointment at Palestinian ingratitude.
Worst of all are the U.S. media, cowed by the fearsome Israeli lobby, with commentators and anchors spinning distorted reports about "crossfire" and "Palestinian violence" that eliminate the fact that Israel is in military occupation and that Palestinians are fighting it.
While the United States celebrates the Serbian people's victory over Milosevic, Clinton and his aides refuse to see the Palestinian insurgency as the same kind of struggle against injustice.
BEIJING (AP) _ With China's next leaders listening, (outgoing) Premier Zhu Rongji convened the country's largely toothless legislature on March 5 and (outlined) the new generation's top goal _ helping the hundreds of millions of people that years of economic boom and wrenching change have left behind.
The National People's Congress is due to take the next step in a transfer of power to a younger generation.
On the agenda for the 2,984 delegates is the appointment of a successor to 76-year-old President Jiang Zemin.
His job is almost certain to Hu Jintao, 60, who (took over) in November as Communist Party general secretary _ though Jiang will stay on in a key military post and many expect he will continue to play a powerful role in Chinese politics.
The party views China's enduring poverty as both a social crisis and a possible threat to its power.
Leaders worry that rising anger about corruption, stagnant incomes among the 800 million people in the countryside and a growing gap between rich and poor could turn volatile.
Zhu, 75, who is set to retire after the congress, made that focus (explicit) in his 90-minute address.
He called for prosperity to be spread to rural China. Jobs should be created and a social safety net for the poor, he said.
``We should continue to take developing agriculture and the rural economy and increasing farmers' income as the top priority of our economic work,'' Zhu said, reading from his 55-page report before a backdrop of red flags.
State television broadcast his comments nationwide.
Nearly a decade (in the making), the generational shift to a cadre of carefully (groomed) party men could become the first (orderly) transfer of power in China's communist history.
``They are more cultured, more knowledgeable, they know more about the world, they have more political experience and they are younger,'' said Shanghai delegation member Chen Chuanwei, sipping tea outside the auditorium where Zhu spoke.
``They are very appropriate to bring us into the new century,'' Chen said.
Outside, security forces (ringed) the building and closed adjacent Tiananmen Square to pedestrians.
The square became a mammoth parking lot for buses that (disgorged) delegates in (finery) ranging from smartly tailored suits of Hong Kong business executives to traditional robes of ethnic Tibetans.
Zhu also (called for) more radical capitalist-style reform, more opening of China's markets to foreign competition and the closure of inefficient companies _ steps bound (to inflict) still more pain.
He said China should ``deepen economic restructuring and open still wider to the outside world,'' creating companies that compete in the global market and (taking advantage of) its 2001 membership in the free-trading World Trade Organization.
Zhu said the government is aiming for 7 percent economic growth this year.
That is the minimum that Chinese officials say they need to create jobs for new workers and millions of others (laid off) in the overhaul of state industry.
The emphasis on rural development is a fundamental shift for the party after years focused on building up export-driven industry that brought in hundreds of billions of dollars of investment.
Officials (have unveiled) ambitious development plans for Tibet, Xinjiang and other remote, impoverished areas, many of them populated by (restive) ethnic minorities.
But with Beijing already running a big budget deficit, many are waiting to see how much it can afford to spend on those efforts in the budget due to be unveiled during the congress.
Other duties for the congress include naming a successor to Zhu, who is expected to hand over his post as China's top economic official to Wen Jiabao, a longtime protege.
After a new president is named, the lone leadership (holdout) will be Jiang himself, who still has his most powerful post as chairman of the party commission that runs China's military.
It isn't clear when Jiang plans (to give up) that post, but it too is expected eventually to go to Hu, already his deputy on the panel.
Xu Genqu, part of the 268-member People's Liberation Army delegation to the congress, said Jiang should (stay on) (atop) the parallel government military commission.
``This is a very good thing for maintaining the stability of our country, and the stable development of the military,'' Xu said. ``We hope he will remain there for a while.''
Sledge Taylor, 48, began farming 25 years ago in Como, Mississippi.
There were about 20 farmers in town.
Now he's one of two.
This is a scenario being repeated in rural communities all over the country.
Department of Labor, despite the fact that the country's agricultural exports are expected to grow.
Farming careers are drying up as surely as sun-parched crops in this year's drought in the Southeast.
Between 1978 and 1998, some 300,000 farms evaporated from the American landscape.
Corporate "factory farms" dominate the farm landscape in the United States today.
Farmers' fortunes have waned for many reasons, some of them complex.
As with other industries in the United States, agriculture has seen consolidation.
It has affected everything from machinery manufacturers to seed companies.
Fewer choices at higher prices for farming necessities.
Congress in 1995 has also hurt farmers.
This legislation phased out farm subsidies, while giving farmers more latitude in deciding what crops and how much acreage to use.
A farmer's income can fluctuate wildly because of droughts and floods, the price of farm equipment and other factors that affect the amount and quality of his products and the demand for them.
The median weekly income of a farmer in 1998 was $447, a little more than $23,000 a year, according to the Department of Labor.
That's about the same wage as can be made by the average forklift operator.
A family farmer has a lot more responsibilities, however, than a forklift operator.
If he grows crops, he must till, plant, fertilize, spray, harvest.
An older farmer may be working the land or growing livestock the same way he's done it for 30 years.
Those methods may have been taught to him by his father and grandfather.
But they may not be enough to survive in the 21st century.
Another strategy is something called "community supported agriculture".
Consumers buy shares of a harvest prior to the planting, freeing the farmer from assuming all the financial risks.
"Each investor has got a piece of that crop," says Ted Quaday, program director for Farm Aid, headquartered in Somerville, Massachusetts.
"We think it's a great system.
Organic farming may also offer promise, especially to younger farmers.
The average age of organic farmers is late 30s, Quaday says.
"And because of environmental degradation, aquaculture is growing in order to meet the demand."
Taylor, a Mississippi farmer is cautiously optimistic that in the long-term, family farmers will rebound.
NEW YORK (AP) _ What caused much of Broadway (to go dark) as contract negotiations between (theater) producers and striking (musicians) (collapsed), silencing (virtually) every (musical)?
No negotiations were planned on March 8, and each side met privately with its own members to assess the situation.
But both sides couldn't even (agree on) what they were talking about.
The union insists the fight to keep minimums _ the number of musicians required for each show _ is part of a larger battle to preserve live music on Broadway.
The League of American Theatres and Producers see it in terms of artistic freedom, hiring only the musicians they say they need.
And as musicians became convinced the so-called virtual orchestras, computer-generated music brought in to replace them, wouldn't work well, they hardened their position on minimums and (walked out) Friday.
What producers didn't expect was that actors and (stagehands) would refuse to cross their (picket lines).
Originally producers proposed the number of musicians required for the large Broadway theaters be reduced to seven, a figure they later raised to 14 and most recently to 15.
The minimums at those large theaters currently range from 24 to 26.
Eighteen musicals, from ``Hairspray'' to ``The Producers'' to ``The Lion King,'' are dark through Sunday and possibly beyond, the first (shutdown) of shows in more than 25 years.
Shutting down these 18 shows has cost about $1.2 million per performance in terms of lost box-office revenue, or nearly $5 million for all four performances this weekend, according to Bernstein.
Picketing (took place) again Saturday in front of theaters before what would have been matinee performances.
Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson stood with musicians in front of ``Chicago,'' in which he plays shady lawyer Billy Flynn, while two stars of ``The Producers,'' Brad Oscar and Gary Beach, were at the St. James Theatre with orchestra players from their show.
``I think we're all surprised and disappointed _ it's not good for anybody,'' a glum Oscar said.
Outside the Palace Theater on 47th Street, home to ``Aida,'' musicians played ``On Broadway'' as protesters gathered.
Later Saturday afternoon, musicians carried a black casket and signs reading ``Don't let producers kill Broadway'' during a march up Times Square.
``We are trying to let people know that we need live music in these shows,'' said Warren Oates, a drummer with ``Thoroughly Modern Millie.''
The strike boosted business for those productions, primarily plays, that are still open.
The revival of ``Cabaret,'' the one Broadway musical unaffected by the strike because it operates under a special contract, had 50 people in line Saturday morning when its box office opened.
The show was expected (to sell out) throughout the weekend.
Business was also strong at ``Take Me Out,'' the Richard Greenberg baseball drama.
The union has been aggressive in (courting) (public opinion) _ producing audiences surveys saying that theatergoers don't want (canned music) (a term the producers hate), (enlisting) the support of Broadway composers such as Jerry Herman and John Kander, and having performers such as Patty Duke and Audra McDonald do (radio commercials) in support of the musicians.
They were helped by the fact that actors disliked rehearsing with the virtual orchestras.
``We're artists and a machine is a dead thing,'' said Harvey Fierstein, star of ``Hairspray.''
One day after sounding an alert, astronomers said additional data had eliminated any chance that a recently discovered space object would collide with Earth in 2030.
The revised forecast shows the object passing no closer than 3 million miles.
The faint object, dubbed 2000 SG344, was the first celestial body to merit a rating higher than zero on the zero-to-10 Torino scale of impact threats.
That may sound like a slight chance by terrestrial standards, but it was a biggie for asteroid-watchers.
But even more "prediscovery" data on SG344 came in from the Catalina Sky Survey.
That gave scientists such a good idea of the object's orbit that they could see it would miss Earth in 2030.
He said there was still a risk of collision in the 2071-73 time frame.
However, additional observations of SG344 between now and then could rule out even those possibilities, he said.
Based on its brightness, astronomers are guessing that the object is 30 to 70 meters wide.
The upper end of that range would put SG344 on the level of the Tunguska Meteorite, which flattened a wide swath of Siberian forest in 1908.
compared with a 20,000-ton yield for the Hiroshima atomic bomb.
_ (Cuddling) may be good medicine for the heart.
A brief hug and 10 minutes of handholding with a romantic partner greatly reduce the harmful physical effects of stress, according to a study reported over the weekend at the American Psychosomatic Society meeting here.
Loving contact before a tough day (at work) ``could (carry over) and protect you throughout the day,'' says psychologist Karen Grewen with the (School) of Medicine at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
In the study, 100 adults with spouses or long-term partners were told to hold hands while (viewing) a pleasant 10-minute video, then asked to hug for 20 seconds.
Another group of 85 rested quietly without their partners.
Then all participants spoke for a few minutes about a recent event that made them angry or stressed.
Typically, asking people to revisit these scenes (drives up) heart rate and (blood pressure).
Their systolic (upper) (reading) jumped 24 points, more than double the rise for huggers, and their diastolic (lower) also rose significantly higher.
Heart rate increased 10 beats a minute for those without contact compared with five beats a minute for huggers.
This is the latest of many studies suggesting humans are ``hard-wired'' to thrive as social animals, says Tiffany Field of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami Medical School.
Field's research shows touch lowers output of cortisol, a stress hormone.
When cortisol dips, there's (a surge) of two ``feel good'' brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine.
Her studies in U.S. and Parisian cafes show that French couples spend about three times as much time touching as Americans.
Comforting physical contact is out of favor among friends and co-workers because of the legal climate, she says.
``If you happen to touch someone at the fax machine, you (run the risk) of being sued.''
Some studies have indicated that touch among friends might be helpful but doesn't produce nearly as much physical stress relief as contact with a partner, says psychologist Kathleen Light, co-author of the UNC study.
The findings suggest one reason that isolated, lonely people tend to have poorer health, says Ohio State University psychologist Janice Kiecolt-Glaser.
Although ours is a youth-oriented culture, older adults may benefit most from touch, she says.
``The older you are, the more fragile you are physically, so contact becomes increasingly important for good health.''
There is one critical part of the financial system which receives far less attention than it deserves:
Over the past 10 years, venture capital has grown far faster than any other financial instrument, soaring from about $5 billion a year to an annual rate of over $100 billion in the first half of 2000.
Combined with the proceeds from initial public offerings (IPOs), this astonishing sum of money flowing to new companies is fueling much of the demand for new computers and telecom equipment, supporting the dot.com advertising boom, and supercharging the labor market for tech workers.
Even more important, by financing the rapid movement of new ideas and new business models into the market, venture capital is dramatically accelerating the rate of technological change.
That makes venture capital a prime support for the innovation and productivity gains which have characterized the New Economy.
Indeed, the lack of an American-style venture capital system is one of the main reasons why countries such as France, Germany, and Japan have lagged behind the U.S. economically in recent years.
But there's a downside.
The new importance of venture capital and IPOs mean that the New Economy, unlike the Old Economy, is subject to tech booms and tech busts.
During the good years, a buoyant financial market makes it easy to find financing for innovative new companies.
And the success of these companies, in turn, pushes the stock market higher.
Technological innovation and financial gains feed on each other.
When the stock market starts to sag, that makes it less profitable to take new companies public.
Venture capital funds, no longer showing big returns, invest less money.
The same forces which helped drive the New Economy could help push it down.
As companies slow down the rate at which they introduce new computer and communication systems, they will need fewer information technology workers, turning the current shortages in the current tech labor market into a surplus.
The pain will hit many of the people who prospered during the high-tech boom.
Scientists in Italy have discovered 350,000-year-old tracks that may be the oldest known footprints made by Stone Age man.
The prints were made by three early, upright-walking humans as they descended the treacherous side of a volcano _ perhaps to escape an eruption, researchers reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
Other scientists said that while the prints appear well-preserved, they add little to knowledge about human evolution, since footprints of far older human ancestors have been found.
But they said the tracks are still a sobering testament to long-ago journeys across a harsh terrain.
One of the footprint trails zigzags to find the safest path down the steep incline.
Another includes handprints someone left as he steadied himself in a precarious spot, only to slide a short way down the slope.
"You're looking at an event that happened 350,000 years ago _ someone made an imprint on a surface, walking in a way you'd expect to see someone in these same conditions walk today," said Owen Lovejoy, an anthropologist at Kent State University who was not involved in the research.
"It adds another cog in the connect between ourselves and our ancestors."
Who left the 56 footprints is not clear.
But their discoverers suggest either late Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis _ two early human species found in Europe during the Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age.
Footprints left by the upright-walking, prehuman species Australopithecus afarensis were found in 1977 in Tanzania, imprinted in volcanic mud 3.6 million years old _ making them 10 times older than the new discovery.
"The bottom line is that these are interesting curiosities that do not advance our knowledge of what happened when in human evolution," said Tim White, a University of California paleontologist who co-discovered the most famous Australopithecus fossil, dubbed Lucy, in Ethiopia in 1974.
The more recent tracks were found in southern Italy's rugged Roccamonfina volcano complex, north of present-day Naples.
The footprints' makers were short _ just under 5 feet tall _ based on the prints' size of less than 8 inches in length, the researchers said.
The trails were left by three individuals who walked across a cooled but recent volcanic flow of rock fragments, ash and gases.
A short time later, the volcano erupted again, blanketing the footprints with a thick layer of ash that preserved them for the ages, said Paolo Mietto of the University of Padua, Italy.
The tracks show that their owners were descending, not climbing, he said.
"The idea that these humans were escaping an eruption ... is attractive, and is supported by the fact that all tracks have the same direction, outwards from the volcano's main crater," Mietto said.
Local residents had long known of the footprints, and referred to them and animal tracks preserved near the volcano as "devils' trails."
Mietto said the prints are unmistakably human in origin, as some preserve the foot's plantar arch and individual toe prints.
John Klensin, a member of the standard-setting Internet Engineering Task Force and chairman of the Internet Architecture Board urged strict adherence to established processes for developing and testing new Internet-wide standards.
VeriSign has authorized 24 companies to participate in its test of registering Internet addresses using non-English characters.
Registration began last week and tens of thousands of names already have been registered.
VeriSign and the other companies are only registering names in Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters and adding them to a database.
Web sites associated with those names will not actually appear in browsers until a later stage in testing.
"I'm very concerned that no one is interested in a controlled test.
We're doing experimental surgery on a live patient."
Other critics say that because the Internet still lacks standards for non-English characters, efforts like VeriSign's are premature.
Computers on the Internet that help users find Web sites were programmed with English in mind, and the engineers who try to keep order on the Net say many of those machines will not understand new languages without software upgrades.
They say tens of thousands of such machines, known as domain name servers, need to be updated.
Until that happens, Web surfers could be blocked from many sites, experts say.
ABOARD THE USS CARL VINSON (AP) _ With war planes lining its deck, a U.S. aircraft carrier anchored off South Korea on Saturday and showed off its military might while North Korea warned that the massing of U.S forces in the region increases the danger of nuclear conflict.
Pyongyang's main state-run daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun said Saturday, ``the U.S. can attack the DPRK any moment,'' using the initials for North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
``The U.S. seeks to round off its preparations for a nuclear war against the DPRK at its final phase and mount a pre-emptive nuclear attack on it any time,'' it added.
Pyongyang has objected to joint U.S. -South Korea military exercises, named Foal Eagle, which began early this month and will continue till April 2, saying they are a rehearsal for invasion.
Meanwhile, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun told his military Saturday to prepare in case North Korea attempts minor provocations to show hostility during the military exercises, South Korean news agency Yonhap said.
Roh's office could not immediately confirm the report.
Wren said the U.S. warship was here ``as a show of solidarity'' with South Korea and to provide a ``deterrence.''
``Certainly our presence in the region is not in direct response on North Korea, but certainly our presence can also be an influence,'' he said.
Donald P. Quinn, commander of Carrier Air Wing Nine, said ``there are greater tensions, which means we have to be better at what we do.''
The carrier has 70 aircraft, a fleet of supporting warships and more than 5,000 sailors and marines.
On Saturday, the carrier was moored just outside the breakwater of Pusan harbor on South Korea's southeast coast.
The forces were joined by six U.S.
Some time in the next few days, the Carl Vinson plans to steam up the coast to support a landing exercise by U.S. and South Korean marines near the port of Pohang, where U.S. troops landed for the 1950-53 Korean War.
On the other hand, about 2,000 students and activists opposing a possible U.S. war against Iraq marched through downtown Seoul.
They also accused Washington of heightening tensions on the Korean Peninsula by refusing to directly deal with North Korea.
In recent weeks, North Korea has escalated tensions by test-firing two short-range missiles and intercepting a U.S. reconnaissance plane off the country's east coast.
Meanwhile, in Berkeley, California, North Korea's U.N. ambassador met with officials from South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and the European Union for talks aimed at allaying tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
However, no one was appearing as an official representative of a country.
``We are having a very lively discussion,'' said Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a University of Tokyo professor and co-chair of the conference.
The Japanese government, meanwhile, has said it is considering strengthening its missile defenses amid reports that North Korea is preparing to test a medium-range missile capable of reaching Japan.
South Korea's military, however, said Saturday it did not believe North Korea was preparing to test-fire its ballistic missiles.
Tokyo's announcement came a day after Japan's Defense Agency said it had deployed an Aegis-equipped destroyer _ which includes top-of-the-line surveillance systems and ship-to-air missiles _ in the waters between Japan and North Korea.
Japan's Kyodo news agency reported Friday that the government was considering sending two more Aegis-equipped destroyers to the waters in response to the possible threat.
The Korean nuclear crisis flared in October, when U.S. officials said Pyongyang admitted having a uranium program. Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments;
the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor that had been mothballed for years under U.N. seal.
Labelling the commercial sexual exploitation of children a 'form of terrorism', the United Nations child welfare agency (UNICEF) has called for a global effort to stamp out the trade.
The conference kicks off where the first congress finished five years ago in Stockholm, Sweden, and with child pornography, trafficking and prostitution on the increase the task has become no easier.
Japanese Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka at the conference called for "resolute and immediate action" across the globe to combat child sex trade.
She told Reuters that "commercial sexual exploitation of children was a grave violation of their human rights."
The meeting comes on the heels of a recent UNICEF report on the commercial sexual exploitation of children "Profiting from Abuse" that provides a barrage of statistics and testimonials from victims.
The report says that in Pakistan, based on reported cases alone, a woman or child is raped on average every three hours.
"From the brothels of Bangkok to the sidewalks of Manila, the train stations of Moscow to the truck routes of Tanzania, the suburbs of New York to the beaches of Mexico, the outrageous is commonplace," the report said.
UNICEF says it is trying to address the underlying causes of child sexual abuse by working to improve access to and quality of education, raising awareness, and advocating for children's rights.
The United Nations says one million children are drawn into prostitution annually.
It estimates that 100,000 children and women in the Philippines, 400,000 in India, 100,000 in Taiwan, 200,000 in Thailand are subject to commercial sexual exploitation in the region.
BEIJING (AP) _ Promoting China's future and his own, new premier Wen Jiabao promised principled, committed leadership on March 18 and said his country must continue its path of reform and elevate rural living standards to keep the future bright.
``Governing China is a project that is extremely demanding. Only by reform, opening up and implementing socialism with Chinese characteristics can we build a more modern, prosperous China,'' Wen said at his debut news conference in the Great Hall of the People.
Wen, 61, was appointed on March 16 and took office immediately, taking charge of an economy that is jerking forward in fits and starts after two decades of economic restructuring started by the late Deng Xiaoping.
He turned to specifics quickly.
Industrial bases in the country's northeast, plagued by unemployment and factory shutdowns, must be tended to as well. Unhappiness among farmers and factory workers could pose real problems for China's communist leadership in its efforts to keep hold of power as it opens its economy to capitalist-style reforms.
Wen also sought to reassure foreign investors by saying private and public companies would receive identical treatment by the government.
``The government has set a firm policy to develop the nonpublic sectors,’’ Wen said.
Wen's appointment Sunday came as part of a generational leadership change that installed the Communist Party's general secretary, Hu Jintao, as president.
Outgoing President Jiang Zemin retained the chair of a powerful military commission _ and probable continuing influence for years.
Wen replaced Zhu Rongji, a crusty reformer who helped China extricate its economy from the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
``But I am also someone with principle, with determination, with the confidence and courage to take up responsibility.''
The state-controlled media have emphasized Wen's connection with ordinary people, showing him communing with wheat farmers, coal miners and rural flood victims.
Wen himself, in his first remarks, invoked that theme and underscored his focus on China's less fortunate.
That experience let me know keenly how hard life could be,'' said Wen, who worked as a geologist in China's hardscrabble Gansu province.
``But that experience filled me with confidence,'' he said.
He praised Zhu and Jiang for their roles in China's recent reform and economic progress.
``Our predecessors have laid a good foundation for us,'' Wen said. ``Yet we still face numerous difficulties and problems ahead, which require innovation and creativity as we press on.''
For the past several years we have been hearing about the gargantuan amounts of wealth rapidly accumulated by tech superstars.
It took John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie a lifetime to become billionaires;
Jay Walker of Priceline.com, Pierre Omidyar of eBay, and Steve Case of America Online did it in less than five years.
What is new is neither affluence nor extravagance, but the number of rich people in America today.
The ranks of the rich have swelled so greatly that it is necessary to establish a new category, the super-rich, to distinguish between people who can afford to live very well and those whose spending habits are only limited by their imagination.
In 1980, if you had a net worth of $1 million you would be considered wealthy.
The term "millionaire" acquired its mystique at a time when the average American was making $10,000 to $12,000 a year.
Today to qualify as rich you need $1 million in annual income, or $10 million in net worth.
According to the Federal Reserve Board, some 250,000 households
But the big story is not about these people.
It is about the explosion in the ranks of the affluent class, the people who make more than $100,000 a year and have a net worth in excess of $1 million.
In 1980, there were fewer than 1 million American families that made, or had, this kind of money.
Today there are approximately 5 million families, or more than 15 million people who qualify.
All this new wealth has generated some interesting conflicts.
Recently, the Wall Street Journal published an article titled, "Even Leftists Have Servants Now."
It profiled several people, many of them college professors, who are for the first time making six-figure incomes.
These people have now hired gardeners, pool men, cooks, and nannies.
Most of these servants are blacks and Mexicans.
The contortions these academics go through to justify their behavior make for amusing reading.
Political scientist Mark Petracca, who teaches at the University of California at Irvine, says he finally agreed to get a nanny, but he absolutely refuses to hire a gardener, even though everybody else in his neighborhood has one.
Petracca says, "It reeks of a kind of imperial colonialism one can imagine present in Shanghai in 1920."
The night sky crackled with flashing light and anti-aircraft fire, reminiscent of the first Gulf War in 1991, as the Tomahawk cruise missiles began dropping on Baghdad once again.
But instead of widespread bombardment, specific targets _ the main presidential palace, the ministry building and Special Republican Guard strongholds _ were struck by the second wave of missiles.
The two buildings were hit almost simultaneously in a day bookended by morning and evening attacks.
The Iraqi military said four soldiers were killed and six others wounded in the day's strikes, during which it said a total 72 cruise missiles were fired.
The morning wave of missiles killed one other person _ apparently a Jordanian civilian _ and injured 14, the International Red Cross confirmed.
While Baghdad was quiet for the rest of the night, air raid sirens were heard before dawn in the key northern city of Mosul and, soon after, several large explosions were heard.
Meanwhile, in southern Iraq, allied forces rained artillery and rockets on Iraq forces and crossed the border from Kuwait.
Thursday night, Iraqi television announcers read a two-minute message from Saddam that mocked U.S. claims that Iraqis would welcome American invaders with open arms.
''God is greater, God is greater, and may the debased ones be accursed.''
In Baghdad, a witness reported seeing anti-aircraft artillery on the roof of the ministry building, which was burning as emergency vehicles rushed to the scene.
The fire was visible from across the river on the east bank of the Tigris.
On a cool, breezy Baghdad night, a thick plume of black smoke climbed into the sky, which was occasionally illuminated by red flares or tracer fire.
The presidential palace sits on the west side of the Tigris River, inside a vast area that stands as the official seat of power in Iraq but is rarely used by Saddam.
The Iraqi leader has access to dozens of palaces.
Three distinct locations in the center of Baghdad were smoking after apparently being bombed.
As dusk fell on that day, many of those left in Baghdad _ ordinarily a city of 5 million _ abandoned its normally bustling streets for the safety of their homes, shelters or the countryside, anticipating night attacks.
By 7:30 p.m. local time, there was hardly anyone on the streets and only a few cars speeding off.
Within 90 minutes, the squawk of air raid sirens filled the air and the second attack was under way.
Although longer in duration than the barrage that launched the war hours earlier, the bombing lasted barely 15 minutes, hardly on the scale of the 1991 bombings.
The blast of the air raid sirens resumed once again later, but there was no further attack.
F-14 and F-18 jets armed with missiles and bombs took off from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in the eastern Mediterranean; their targets were unknown.
Pentagon officials have described their war strategy as ``shock and awe,'' saying they planned to drop 10 times the bombs in the opening days of the air campaign in Iraq than they did in the first Gulf war.
Hundreds of armed members of Saddam's Baath party were hunkered down in the capital, waiting for the United States to unleash its full might, but there was no indication of when that might happen.
On Iraq Radio, a spokesman said that the first attack of the war had targeted Saddam's family home, as well as the homes of his two sons.
The spokesman condemned ``the missiles of the reckless criminal Bush and his lackeys.''
A survey of what people know about AIDS found that four out of 10 mistakenly believe it is possible to get the disease by sharing a drinking glass or being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person.
"It's scary that so many people are still so ignorant of what causes HIV/AIDS," said Marty Algaze, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis.
"Almost 20 years into this epidemic, it's disturbing that people think you could still get it from casual contact."
About 40 percent of the more than 5,600 participants said it was very likely, somewhat likely or somewhat unlikely that HIV could be transmitted by sharing a glass.
"Very unlikely" and "impossible" were the other choices.
Forty-one percent said transmission is possible by being coughed or sneezed on by someone with the virus.
Between 800,000 and 900,000 Americans have been infected with HIV.
Melanie Thompson, founder of the AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta, said the survey underscores that many people still consider AIDS a "gay disease" and "didn't bother to educate themselves about the facts."
Major rallies were held in Barcelona, where more than 500,000 people took to the streets, London, Montreal, New York, Paris, Rome, Washington and other major cities in the Middle East and Asia.

The condition is fundamentally a brain problem that occurs when a person crosses time zones suddenly, which throws the brain's clock out of synch.
Veteran long-distance traveler Les Adams said he found his solution by applying the findings of a scientific study on jet lag to his own travel routine.
Adams said he was inspired by an article in the prestigious medical journal Science, in which researchers concluded that light behind the knees might be an effective way to treat jet lag.
He went to his local hardware store and purchased a couple of mag lights that he uses to shine light on the back of his knees during flights.
Although Adams' solution gets him a lot of attention during flights, the reasoning behind it may not be that farfetched.
The theory is that light hits the blood vessels behind the knee, which kicks off a chemical process that resets the brain's clock.
And while scientists need more studies before they endorse Adams' remedy, they do agree that the best way to reset the brain's clock to adjust to a new time zone is with light.
"The solution to jet lag... the ultimate solution, if you can do it, is total control of light and dark," says sleep physiologist Dr.
He recommends the use of an anti-jet lag device that travelers can set to receive a dose of light shining in their eyes while they're in flight.
For travelers who need to arrive at their destination ready for action, a jet-lag pill might be a good solution.
The pill is actually an over-the-counter vitamin B supplement known as NADH and marketed as ENADA.
NADH acts like a spark plug to create energy in cells that may translate into improved brain functions.
Even though it is not a stimulant, it may affect a person's alertness.
Operators shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant with the flip of a switch, closing the facility for good 14 years after it spawned the world's worst nuclear accident.
The simple procedure ended the long and troubled run of the facility that became a synonym for nuclear fears and the dangers of atomic power.
Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma gave the shutdown order from Kiev over a video linkup with the plant, located some 85 miles away.
3 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant," Kuchma said.
Within seconds, a dial showed the reactor's output dropping to zero.
The procedure went flawlessly, the plant reported.
The shutdown, which followed years of intense international pressure, should erase the danger of future accidents at the plant.
Yet Ukraine will suffer the effects of the 1986 Chernobyl accident for years to come:
Millions of its citizens are affected by radiation-related ailments.
The leaders of this former Soviet republic said they were undertaking a historic mission in closing down the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl.
"The world will become a safer place.
People will sleep in peace," Kuchma said during a ceremony to commemorate the shutdown.
The plant's last reactor, the one shut down last Thursday, was reactor No.
It is located in the same building as reactor No.
4, which exploded and caught fire on April 26, 1986, contaminating vast areas of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus and spewing a radioactive cloud over Europe.
The Kremlin tried to conceal the accident and delayed evacuation of people from nearby towns for days.
Firefighters and other workers who were the first at the destroyed reactor had little or no protection from radiation.
More than 4,000 cleanup workers have died since and 70,000 have been disabled by radiation in Ukraine alone.
About 3.4 million of Ukraine's 50 million people, including some 1.26 million children, are considered affected by Chernobyl.
Many Ukrainians, tired of living with radiation scares, were relieved at its closure.
to win the top Oscar and also took home the most trophies, six.
Its other awards were supporting actress for Catherine Zeta-Jones, and four technical honors including costume design and art direction.
World events sparked several emotional highlights, including Brody's tearful speech urging prayers for peace and an attack on U.S. President George W. Bush and the war by filmmaker Michael Moore, winner of the best-documentary Oscar for ``Bowling for Columbine.''
Small pins inspired by Picasso's ``Dove of Peace'' were visible on the lapels and dresses of some people in attendance.
Brody's victory was something of a surprise, as was the awarding of the best-director Oscar to Roman Polanski, also for ``The Pianist.''
Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself in his native Poland, has been an exile from the United States since fleeing 25 years ago to avoid sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl.
``The Pianist'' also won the adapted-screenplay award for Ronald Harwood, giving it a total of three, while Pedro Almodovar earned the original-screenplay prize for ``Talk to Her.''
``Chicago'' came in with a leading 13 nominations, followed by the crime epic ``Gangs of New York'' with 10.
But ``Gangs'' was shut out in every category, including best director, where Martin Scorsese was a sentimental favorite.
Once a Hollywood staple, musicals hit a critical peak 40 years ago with best-picture Oscar winners that included ``West Side Story,'' ``My Fair Lady'' and ``The Sound of Music.''
In ``Chicago,'' Zeta-Jones played a jailed vaudeville scamp scheming for celebrity after slaying her husband and sister.
Due to deliver her second child with husband and Oscar winner Michael Douglas in a few weeks, Zeta-Jones joined co-star and fellow supporting-actress nominee Queen Latifah in the Oscar performance of ``I Move On,'' the best-song nominee from ``Chicago.''
``My hormones are too way out of control to be dealing with this,'' Zeta-Jones said after winning.
``My experience making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people in times of war, and the repercussions of war.
Documentary winner ``Bowling for Columbine'' is Moore's alternately hilarious and horrifying examination of gun violence in America.

Kidman's Oscar win was a Hollywood ending for her after a turbulent couple of years.
She had a miscarriage in 2001 and broke up with husband Tom Cruise, in whose shadow she had lingered throughout their 11-year relationship.
In ``The Hours,'' Kidman played suicidal author Woolf, wearing a fake nose to capture the writer's plain features.
``Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil,'' Kidman said.
``Because art is important.
And because you believe in what you do and you want to honor that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.''
Cooper, a veteran character actor whose credits include ``American Beauty'' and ``Lone Star,'' played a man on a mission to preserve rare orchids in the film loosely based on author Susan Orlean's ``The Orchid Thief.''
``In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us all peace,'' Cooper said as he received his award.
``Lose Yourself,'' from the film ``8 Mile'' starring Eminem, won the best-song Oscar for the rap star and his co-writers, Jeff Bass and Luis Resto.
``I think he's going to feel great about the Oscar,'' Resto said backstage, after accepting the award for the absent Eminem.
The Oscar for foreign-language film went to the German drama ``Nowhere in Africa,'' about a family of Jews who leave Germany before World War II and settle on a farm in Kenya.
The Japanese fantasy ``Spirited Away'' won the award for animated feature film.
The movie, which had a limited U.S. release last fall and grossed a modest $5.5 million, was a surprise winner against a field of nominees that included $100 million Hollywood hits ``Ice Age'' and ``Lilo & Stitch.''
ABC News twice offered a brief war update, then switched back to the Oscars.
Earlier, demonstrators on both sides of the war issue gathered near Hollywood's Kodak Theatre, site of the Oscars.
Anti-war protesters held signs such as ``Bush Betrays USA,'' ``Bush:
Half a block from the area where stars arrived, supporters of U.S. troops in Iraq chanted ``USA, USA,'' and held a banner reading ``God Bless America.''
Planners scrapped the glitzy red-carpet arrival festivities.
And besides wearing peace pins, a few celebrities, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins among them, showed up in fuel-efficient gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles instead of limousines as a statement against U.S. dependence on overseas oil.
After a few initial references to the war and its effects on the Oscars, Martin's opening monologue stuck to mocking nominees, other celebrities and Hollywood at large.
And in a rarity, the show ran just over its allotted 3-hour time.
Some past Oscar shows, including last year's, have topped four hours.
Australian scientists have warned that the reassuring smell of a new car actually contains high levels of toxic air emissions that can make drivers ill.
A study by Australia's main scientific body found high levels of toxic emissions in cars for up to six months and longer after they leave the showroom.
and Xylene isomers, a foetal development toxic agent.
"To avoid some exposure to this toxic cocktail people who buy new cars should make sure there is plenty of outside air entering the vehicle while they drive for at least six months."
The two-year study of three new cars found anecdotal evidence that drivers were becoming ill when they drove their cars.
A lawyer reported being ill with headaches, lung irritation and swellings for several days after collecting a new car and driving it for only 10 minutes.
When he swapped his new car for an 18-month-old car he no longer felt ill.
The study found two new Australian-made cars had very high levels of volatile organic compounds, up to 64,000 micrograms per cubic meter, three to 10 weeks after manufacture.
A third car in the study was imported to Australia, but four months after manufacture it contained high levels of toxic air emissions, recording 2,000 micrograms per cubic meter.
SEOUL(AP) _ With opposition growing to the Iraq war, South Korean lawmakers postponed a vote for a second time on March 28 on a contentiousbill authorizing the dispatch of 700 non-combat military personnel to the Gulf.
The National Assembly originally had planned to vote on the bill on March 25, but postponed it until March 28 before deciding to debate it for two extra days, assembly spokesman Kim Young-il said.
President Roh Moo-hyun urged the National Assembly and the public to support the bill, saying it is in the country's strategic interest.
About 37,000 U.S. military personnel are based in South Korea to protect it from an attack by North Korea, in a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.
The test of their ties comes at a sensitive time on the Korean Peninsula.
The United States has accused communist North Korea of developing nuclear weapons and the North has heightened its defenses and accused Washington of planning to invade.
Referring to the bill to dispatch troops to Iraq, the statement said, ``There is so little reason to pass the motion and so many reasons to vote it down.''
Thousands of South Koreans have joined anti-war protests in Seoul and other major cities in recent days.

Women have jumped ahead of men for the first time in using the Internet to do their holiday shopping, according to a study released Tuesday.
No longer the domain of young, wealthy white men, the Internet has also attracted more minority shoppers, the study said.
"It shows how mainstream the Internet is becoming," said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a nonprofit group that authored the study.
"The online world now looks a lot like the off-line world."
Rainie said it was only a matter of time before women shoppers caught up with men, because women traditionally control the household's spending decisions.
Internet users did some of their buying online this year, versus a fifth of them last year.
Of those, 58 percent were women.
The study also noted that a third of all online shoppers bought gifts from computers at work.
Eleven million first-time shoppers spent money online this holiday season.
Last year, 51 percent of American Internet users said they had purchased something online.
This year, the number rose to 58 percent.
Measured by income, however, wealthy Americans are still the most likely to cyber-shop.
The study cited cyber-shopping increases of 50 percent or more among blacks and Hispanics, alongside increases in overall Internet use.
are window-shopping:
looking for gifts and comparing prices online, then dashing off to the mall to make the deal.
"The Web site is becoming a promotion piece for the store," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, which covers consumer spending patterns.
"They see the item on the screen and they compare it with others.
But they want to go and see what it really looks like, maybe touch it."
Online merchants share some of the credit for the increase, said Dan Hess, vice president of comScore Networks, a research firm that tracks online buying behavior.
Hess said online stores designed Web sites to make shopping easier, while convincing customers of the security of their credit card numbers.
"It's all about making the shopping experience more efficient, more reliable and more comfortable," Hess said.
HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong health officials on March 30 reported 60 more people had fallen ill with a deadly flu-like disease, more than half of them in one apartment complex, pushing the number of infections worldwide past 1,600.
An old Hong Kong woman became the territory's 13th fatality.
Earlier, Christian and Taoist groups in Hong Kong sought to calm fears through prayer.
New cases of ``severe acute respiratory syndrome,’’ or SARS, have picked up pace here the past few days.
At least 56 people have now died of SARS worldwide.
U.S. experts said anyone planning nonessential travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore or Hanoi ``may wish to postpone their trips.''
Julie Gerberding warned that the ``global epidemic continues to expand.''
At least 59 suspected SARS cases are being monitored in the United States and 37 in Canada, where three people have died.
Hong Kong has now reported 530 cases of SARS, although officials also noted that 60 patients here have recovered and been discharged.
The 74-year-old woman, with a history of health problems, died early on March 30.
Hong Kong is the second-hardest hit place after mainland China, which has reported some 800 cases and 34 deaths.
The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the increasing spread of the disease in Hong Kong.
Thirty-six of the new cases of SARS came from Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens apartment complex, where a victim recently spread the disease and it took hold, according to a Health Department statement.
Some frightened residents have moved out and medical teams have gone through the apartments to check for SARS _ while some minibus drivers won't stop there anymore.
Between 110 and 120 SARS cases have come from Amoy Gardens, which is located in Kowloon Bay, a government spokeswoman said Sunday night, using customary anonymity.
Thousands more Hong Kong people have put on surgical masks, taxi drivers cleaned out their cars, concerts and protests were canceled and the horse-racing track in suburban Shatin saw its lowest attendance ever as many of the territory's fervent gamblers stayed home.
Carlo Urbani, 46, an Italian WHO expert on communicable diseases who identified the SARS outbreak in Hanoi, died on March 29 in Thailand where he had been receiving treatment after becoming infected in Vietnam.
Urbani had identified the mysterious disease in an American businessman who had been admitted to a hospital in Hanoi, where he later died.
The WHO says the disease is spreading via international travelers, and nations across Asia are fighting to contain the illness.
Taiwan's premier urged citizens on March 30 to postpone visits to China for the traditional Ching Ming tomb-sweeping festival, as the island announced its 13th SARS case.
Thousands of Taiwanese had been expected to fly to China this week to worship ancestors and sweep their tombs in the festival Saturday.
Thailand stepped up monitoring at airports and border checkpoints Sunday following the Italian doctor's death.
About a dozen visitors were quarantined, but most were quickly released when it became apparent they did not have SARS.
SARS spread to other countries from Hong Kong after an infected mainland Chinese medical professor passed the illness to seven other people in a Kowloon hotel last month and they, in turn, carried the disease to Singapore, Vietnam and Canada.
Hong Kong health officials said Sunday that a man who came down with the illness had been aboard Dragonair flight KA901 from Beijing-Hong Kong on March 26 and they were trying to trace the other 222 passengers and 15 crew to see if they were infected.
About 50 people from Christian churches prayed in a downtown Hong Kong park, displaying a banner that said: ``Don't be afraid, just believe.''
``We hope God will calm those people who are in fears and impress Hong Kong people to hold on together while going through the difficulties,'' said a statement from the Hong Kong Christian Church Council.
The Taoist Wong Tai Sin Temple held a six-hour prayer session for world peace and an end to the SARS outbreak.
Horse racing is a serious passion in Hong Kong, but just 13,237 people showed up for Saturday's races in Shatin, the lowest figure since the track opened in 1978, the Hong Kong Jockey Club said Sunday.
A week earlier, 34,624 had gone to the races.
Sunday's newspapers ran pictures of empty seats and fans in masks.
Canceled or postponed events have included Rolling Stones concerts in Hong Kong and mainland China, an anti-war rally in Hong Kong on Saturday and a demonstration Sunday by foreign maids protesting a wage cut.
Newspapers reported 10,000 staffers in McDonald's restaurants across Hong Kong are wearing masks.

An asteroid that could pulverize a country zipped close by the Earth last Monday, only weeks after astronomers first noticed the big space boulder heading in our direction.
The range might seem like enough to breath easy, about 600,000 km, but many scientists classify it as a relatively close call.
The asteroid, officially known as 2001 YB5, measures between 300 and 400 meters in width.
If such a rock were to smash into the planet, it would unleash the same amount of energy as many nuclear bombs, astronomers estimate.
"The impact would be quite tremendous.
"The environmental consequences would be regional but the social and economic consequences would be global."
Close encounters with giant space rocks are not uncommon.
Asteroids comparable to 2001 YB5 could strike the Earth as frequently as once every 5,000 years, Peiser said.
In much rarer instances, boulders one kilometer or greater in size have smacked into the planet and snuffed out most life forms, much like the 10-km long monster thought to have forced dinosaurs to exit stage left about 65 million years ago, according to scientists.
In the year 2027, an asteroid between one kilometer and mile in length is expected pass even closer than 2001 YB5.
Having pinpointed its orbital path, scientists dismissed any potential of danger.
What particularly troubles Peiser is that scientists only first spotted 2001 YB5 in early December.
What if it had been heading on a collision course?
"That's not enough time for any initiatives for deflection.
If we had 20 or 30 years' time, then we could develop a technology to deflect an object.
(AP) _ The French player stood on the 18th tee holding on to a two-shot lead in a major championship.
It may have sounded familiar, but this wasn't the British Open.
And Patricia Meunier-Lebouc, 31, was about to show she was no Jean Van de Velde.
Eighth-grader Michelle Wie was never a factor, missing several short putts to finish seven shots back after a final-round 76.
The 13-year-old Korean-American from Hawaii began the day four strokes behind Meunier-Lebouc.
She was three shots back at the turn but 3-putted the par-511th after hitting the green in two.
``That just brought me down,'' said Wie, who went on to 3-putt the 15th hole, too.
She did, if only because she handled the pressure of being in contention in a major championship for the first time so well.
Meunier-Lebouc had to overcome an out-of-bounds tee shot on the third hole with some steady play in the final holes to deny Sorenstam's bid to become the first LPGA player to win the same major title three years in a row.
She birdied the 13th hole to take the lead, then parredputtbogey on the final hole gave her a 1-over 73 and a one-shot win over Sorenstam.
``I think I played pretty well all day,'' Wie said.
Park Se-ri, who started the day in the third place, tumbled all the way to 15th after a disastrous 3-over and 291 shots for the tournament.
Korean-American rookie Christina Kim was 28th at 7-over, three strokes ahead of Gloria Park in the 42nd.
Kim Mi-hyun, 26, finished up in 57th place at 13-over.
Along the way, Meunier-Lebouc thought of her 30th birthday party last fall and the fun she had with friends and family who gathered to celebrate.
``I was thinking about that night and all the joy I had,'' she said.
``That's exactly what I wanted to feel on the course.''
Sorenstam wanted to go for the green on the par-518th but couldn't after her tee shot on 18 ended up in a fairway bunker.
Meunier-Lebouc's was there, too, but she wasn't about to make a triple bogey like Van de Velde did.
Meunier-Lebouc did 3-putt the final green, but it didn't matter by that time because Sorenstam had missed her last-gasp birdie putt of 25 feet from the fringe.
``I was swinging so hard on that drive,'' Sorenstam said of her tee shot on 18.
``I had nothing to lose.
It was all or nothing.''
Meunier-Lebouc tapped in to win, got hugs all around and then was carried into the pond by her husband, Antoine, as her caddie joined her in a wet celebration.
``It had to be my husband and caddie in the water with me,'' she said.
She knew it well, after playing her last six rounds with Sorenstam and using the knowledge gathered to remain composed under the pressure of playing a final round in a major championship.
``I was feeling shy until she made the birdie on 12 and took the lead,'' Meunier-Lebouc said.
Meunier-Lebouc eagled the second hole by pitching in, but her celebration turned to disgust one swing later when her tee shot on the third hole went out of bounds.
Sorenstam had won the last two Kraft Nabiscos and was trying to become the first LPGA player to win the same major three times in a row.
She has 42 wins to just one for Meunier-Lebouc, who won the State Farm Classic last year.
It was Sorenstam, though, who cracked, three-putting the 13th hole after taking the lead with a birdie the hole before and then nearly hitting her next shot on the 14th hole into the water.
Sorenstam finished with a 1-under 71 for third place, three strokes ahead of rookie Lorena Ochoa, who shot a final-round 68.
It was the second straight week Sorenstam had a chance to win, and both times she lost with a final-round 71.
Sorenstam wasn't all that unhappy with her score, either, though her putter let her down throughout the tournament.
She missed makable birdie putts on the front nine before finally holing a 5-footer on 10 that tied her for the lead and a 20-footer on 12 that gave her a one-shot advantage.
But just as Sorenstam took the lead, she gave it right back.
Sorenstam 3-putted the 13th hole and then bogeyed the next hole, despite a fortunate bounce off the rock fronting the green that kept the ball out of the water.
``There's really no excuse for making bogey that way,'' she said.
The World Health Organization has released a report about how disease weakens the economies of poor countries.
For years, people believed that good health is a direct result of strong economic development.
However, this study suggests the opposite is true.
It says that strong economic development is an important result of improved health.
An international committee of economists and experts in public health and policy carried out study.
It is based on almost 90 investigations in countries around the world.
Some people say the study is the most complete examination to link investments in health care to economic growth.
The study calls for a large increase in foreign aid for health care services in developing countries.
In the world’s richest countries, total spending for health care for each person is almost 2,000 dollars a year.
However, in the world’s poorest nations, spending on health care for each person is only thirteen dollars a year.
The WHO says this amount should be increased to 38 dollars a year for each person by 2015.
The money would help poor nations provide treatment for diseases.
It would also provide babies with important health care early in life.
Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, led the study.
He says about eight million lives could be saved each year if the richest nations increased spending on health care in developing countries.
Sachs says more than fifty of the world’s poorest countries would have a chance to improve the living and economic conditions for their people.
The study links political crises in developing countries to high death rates among newborn babies.
The report also provides new information about how AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria affect economic growth in developing countries.
The researchers suggest 8,000 million dollars be provided each year to help fight these diseases.
The WHO plans to send the study to many officials around the world.
They include heads of state, ministers of finance, health and trade, members of national parliaments and non-governmental organizations.
It says the report is a valuable guide for future international health programs, policies and financing.
He flicks a finger across his throat in a threatening knife-slash gesture.
Such attempts to intimidate are regular these days from communist troops who face South Korean troops and the small number of U.S. soldiers in the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas, according to U.S.
South Korean troops do their own posturing.
Just meters (yards) from the North's soldiers in Panmunjom, a military village that straddles the border, the South's soldiers stand in taekwondo poses, ready to fight _ legs apart, arms bent and fists clenched.
Such antagonism along the border has come and gone as tensions have ebbed and spiked on the Korean Peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean War.
Now, its resurgence shows another chill in relations.
Washington has accused the North of having a secret nuclear weapons program, in violation of a 1994 pact.
Pyongyang says its nuclear development is for peaceful purposes, and that it fears Washington will invade North Korea once it's done with Iraq.
President George W. Bush has said he wants to resolve the crisis peacefully, but has not ruled out a military solution.
Earlier this week, the United States said it was keeping stealth fighter jets in South Korea after they arrived last month for a training exercise.
The radar-evading F-117s are capable of taking out the North's Yongbyon nuclear plant _ an attack North Korea has accused Washington of plotting.
The Korean border is the world's most heavily fortified, with almost 2 million troops deployed on the peninsula, including 37,000 Americans stationed in South Korea.
Last week, North Korea suspended the sole regular contact with the U.S.-led United Nations Command that monitors the Korean War armistice.
Those weekly meetings in Panmunjom, though usually quick and businesslike, were an important diplomatic portal used to keep the peace between the two sides, which are still technically at war.
In better days _ such as in 2000, when North and South Korean leaders held a summit in Pyongyang _ senior military officers from both sides sometimes relaxed over drinks after their formal meetings, said Steve Oertwig, a U.S. military spokesman.
``Every now and then, they may have an alcoholic beverage.
It's not a big party,'' Oertwig said.
``It's a chance to encourage trust and build a relationship with them.
It's part of being a sociable host.
Both sides would toast each other for peace and cooperation on the Korean Peninsula.''
Panmunjom was quiet when the AP visited this week.
North Korean soldiers stood well back from a small concrete seam in the earth that marks the frontier.
There was no sign of the threatening gestures mentioned by Margotta, head of the local U.N.
But Northern soldiers peered south through binoculars and cameras, and grimaced at visiting journalists.
A group of South Korean school children on a trip to the zone looked into one of three blue huts used for the talks.
In the small building, a boardroom table _ half of it in North Korea and half in the South _ was bare, except for a small U.N. flag.
The chairs were empty.
Two impassive South Korean soldiers stood guard.
It's not clear when the meeting hut will again be used _ or if there will be talks at a higher level to try to defuse the latest tension.
North Korea has repeatedly refused to hold multilateral talks on the nuclear issue, insisting on direct meetings with the United States to negotiate a nonaggression treaty.
Washington has so far refused.
Security Council plans to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue next week.
It sounds almost like a plot line from "Star Trek"
a patient's life is saved thanks to a tiny microchip implanted in his body that lets a doctor detect a dangerous condition before it becomes critical.
Researchers are testing an implantable microsensor that can send data to a hand-held receiver outside the body, alerting doctors to a potential medical crisis, without using any wires or batteries.
They call it a micro-electro mechanical systems device, or MEMS.
The doctor would be able to check the condition of a patient's heart, for example, by holding the receiver near the patient rather than putting him through a costly CAT scan or surgery.
Jay Yadav at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
Yadav developed the device with colleagues Mark Allen and David Stern of CardioMEMS, the Atlanta, Georgia-based company he co-founded.
Allen, a professor of electrical engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, originally invented the sensor for use in jet engines.
If it works, it could provide doctors with an easier way to catch serious problems.
The MEMS has successfully measured blood pressures in a healthy dog, a step doctors call a "milestone."
Next, they will test the sensor in dogs with aneurysms to see how well it performs.
Human trials of the device are also planned.
it might be used in obstetrics to monitor contractions wirelessly;
electrical signals, for instance, or glucose levels.
And though a minor surgical procedure would be required to implant the chip, the actual monitoring would be "very user-friendly," Yadav says, requiring no special training.
the chip dislodging, or the body having some kind of reaction to the plastic used to make the sensor.
But they envision few complications.
The man, who prefers to go by just his first name of Mohammed for now, learned of the captured soldier's location when he went to Saddam Hospital to see his wife, Iman, who is a nurse.
He noticed an unusual number of security personnel ringing the building.
''I decided to go to the Americans and tell them the story,'' he said.
Lynch, 19, was seized March 23 along with 12 other soldiers when their supply convoy took a wrong turn as it passed the southern Iraqi town of Nasiriyah.
She was rescued nine days later in a mission by U.S. commandos and is recovering from injuries at a military hospital in Germany.
Telling the Americans was no easy matter.
Mohammed walked more than 6 miles out of Nasiriyah, through what Marines have nicknamed ''Ambush Alley,'' to reach a U.S. military checkpoint.
A Marine asked what he wanted.
''Important information about woman soldier,'' he replied in broken English.
At the Marines' request, he returned twice to get details of its layout, security and Lynch's exact position.
He drew five maps for rescuers.
Twelve solders from Lynch's unit, the Army's 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company, a non-combat unit based at Fort Bliss, Texas, are missing or prisoners of war.
Two others were killed in the ambush.
She was lying in bed with a blanket drawn up to her chin, he said.
''She think I doctor,'' Mohammed recalled of his visit to Jessica.
I said, 'Don't worry,' and she smiled.''
An Iraqi pharmacist at Saddam Hospital said Lynch knew U.S. troops were on the other side of the Euphrates River, which is just a mile away.
Greg Lynch was already making plans for what happens when his daughter gets home.
He promised "one of the biggest bashes Wirt County, W. Va., has ever seen."

Guilt, psychologists like Suffolk University professor Jane Bybee say, is useful, because it gets people to regret the wrong they do, and correct it.
"They feel a sense of remorse over it.
They wish that they could undo it.
They feel, they ruminate over it," Bybee said.
"One of the markers of a psychopath is that the person doesn't experience guilt at all," she said.
Serial killer Ted Bundy, for example, said he felt no guilt after killing 28 people.
So we want people to feel guilt.
And as parents, we want our kids to feel guilt
not just so they won't grow up to be psychopaths, but because guilt, say the experts, makes you less inclined to cheat, steal, or do drugs.
Research shows kids who have a little guilt are better citizens.
Since a little guilt is good, you would think a lot would be even better.
But the experts say too much guilt
and not being able to get rid of it
Bad parenting can induce that kind of excess guilt.
Bybee says relentless criticism of the child rather than the child's behavior creates bad guilt.
What should we do about it?"
Don't tell them what to do, she said, let them figure it out.

Dutch scientists have found that drinking alcohol up to three times daily can almost halve the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, a report has said.
The beverage is not restricted to just red wine, which has been reported in the past as helping reduce heart problems.
Drinking a moderate amount of any alcoholic beverage
between one and three drinks a day
helped prevent Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.
The smaller the amounts of alcohol drunk, the smaller the benefits.
Heavy drinking, however, which is categorised as more than four glasses a day, diminished the health benefits of moderate drinking.
Dutch researchers at Erasmus University in Rotterdam carried out a six-year study of 5,395 people aged 55 and over who showed no signs of dementia.
The scientists checked their drinking habits and monitored their state of health.
By the end of the study, 197 participants had developed Alzheimer’s or other dementia conditions.
But those who consumed between one and three drinks a day had a 42% lower risk of developing dementia than non-drinkers.
A clear correlation was seen between the level of alcohol consumption and the degree of dementia risk.
Volunteers who did not drink every day but had more than one tipple a week had a 25% lower risk.
Those who drank less than a glass a week had 18% less risk than teetotallers.
Heavy drinkers were one-and-a-half times more likely than non-drinkers to suffer from vascular dementia caused by blocked or narrowed blood vessels in the brain, and slightly more likely to develop Alzheimer’s.
Excess drinking destroys the liver, and can be toxic to the brain.
Alcoholics can end up with a shrunken brain, which is linked to dementia.
There is even a medical condition called alcoholic dementia.
Researchers suggested the blood-thinning and cholesterol-lowering properties of ethanol in alcohol may ward off dementia, which is often caused by a blood vessel problem.
Another possibility, the study speculated, is that low levels of alcohol could stimulate the release acetylcholine, a brain chemical believed to facilitate learning and memory.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Astounding even veterans of the fight against animal extinction, cloning technology has reproduced two endangered wild cattle, birthed by a cow last week on an Iowa farm.
One of the bulls weighed twice as much as expected and it was euthanized on April 8.
The procedure that created the bantengs has given conservationists hope that cross-species breeding can help reverse the daily disappearance of 100 species and add genetic diversity to dwindling animal populations.
If it survives, the remaining banteng will be transferred to the San Diego Wild Animal Park and encouraged to breed.
The technology is still fraught with problems and a long way from paying significant dividends.
The cloned banteng, for instance, won't begin breeding until it reaches maturity in about six years.
Nonetheless, animal conservationists are excited about the results.
In 1977, the zoo began preserving cells and genetic material from hundreds of animals in a program it dubbed the Frozen Zoo.
Tissue samples from each animal are stored in small plastic vials, which are submerged and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
``At the time we did not know how this resource might be used, but we knew it was important to save as much information about endangered species as we could,'' Ryder said.
Now, that foresight is beginning to pay off with the banteng, a white-stockinged animal hunted for its slender, curved horns.
Fewer than 8,000 bantengs exist in the wild, most on the island of Java.
Ryder and his colleagues sent frozen skin cells from a long-dead banteng to researchers at the cloning company Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Massachusetts.
Scientists there fused the banteng skin cells with 30 cow eggs that had their genetic material removed.
Another biotechnology company, Trans Ova Genetics of Hull, Iowa, then implanted the cloned eggs into cows in Sioux Center, Iowa.
Of the 16 resulting pregnancies, only two came to term last week _ and one of the bantengs weighed 80 pounds (36 kilograms), about twice as heavy as expected.
The researchers euthanized the fatter banteng Tuesday, concluding it had little chance to survive.
This is not the first cross-species cloning experiment that resulted in a birth.
Two years ago, a cow gave birth to an endangered cloned wild ox named Noah.
But Noah died two days later of dysentery.
All of which underscores the many problems with cloning technology.
Even same-species cloning has a high failure rate, and surviving animals are often less healthy than naturally born animals.
Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal, was put to death in February after premature aging and disease marred her short existence.
The decision to end Dolly's life at age 6 _ about half the life expectancy of her breed _ was made because she had a progressive lung disease.
Others fear scientists will embrace cloning technology at the expense of tried-and-true conservation practices like habitat preservation and conservation.
But Ryder and others who embrace the technology say they would be remiss to ignore cloning, which can augment, rather than replace, existing methods.
Despite conservation efforts, habitats around the world are still disappearing quickly.
``Nobody mentions it, but I'm sure wildlife is disappearing there.''
Dresser's projects include working to impregnate domestic felines with cloned endangered wild cats.
``Cloning could be a powerful tool,'' Dresser said.
So far, though, she hasn't succeeded in bringing such a cat to term.
Researchers in China, meanwhile, are working with rabbits as surrogates for cloned pandas, which are about the size of a stick of butter when they're born.
Genetic material from the woolly mammoth and other extinct animals has never been properly stored in high-tech freezers like those at the San Diego Zoo, so their DNA has long since disappeared from the planet.

A new State Forestry Administration survey shows that 2.7 million square kilometers of land was desert by the end of 1999, the state-run China Daily reported.
This was a rise of 52,000 square kilometers of desert from the first desertification survey in 1994.
Northern and western parts of China were the most vulnerable, including the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang, and the northern provinces of Hebei and Shanxi.
While global warming may have played some part in the rise, the survey showed that people were responsible for turning 18.2 percent, or 1.74 million square kilometers, of China into desert.
"Most dry lands in China have been degraded by over-cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation, and poor irrigation practices, as well as abnormal weather changes such as persistent droughts," the official Xinhua news agency quoted the survey as saying.
Another 17,000 square kilometers of reclaimed land had also turned to desert, the report said.
The impact of land turning into desert is not restricted to China's borders alone.
Last year, a sprawling Asian dirt storm blew across the Pacific and sprinkled millions of tons of the Gobi and Takla Makan deserts as far east as Florida, making one of the largest North American dust clouds ever recorded.
Such episodes have comparatively little effect on air quality in the United States.
But the periodic plumes cause major headaches in cities hundreds of kilometers downwind like Beijing, blotting out the sun, slowing traffic and closing airports.
The eastward winds have long spurred protests from residents of Korea and Japan, who have faced similar, if milder, dust epidemics from China.
The three nations have organized a committee to find a strategy to combat the dust, according to the Earth Policy Institute, an environmental advocacy group.
The country's official news agency says that more than 110 Chinese cities are suffering from a severe water shortage due to a lack of resources, water pollution and a deterioration of the environment.
Industrialization has dried up rivers, wells, and springs, affecting the supply of clean drinking water and the irrigation of farmlands.
It is estimated that around 700 million people out of China's 1.2 billion, drink contaminated water.
A movie featuring late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping will be hitting the mainland silver screens this summer.
Nine years in the making and costing $2.4 million, a lot by local production standards, the new film aims to cement Deng's place in China's history.
Beijing Film Productions, in the biographic epic that covers the final 20 years of Deng's life, is also attempting to answer some outstanding questions about his legacy to the nation.
The film, which has now been officially approved, is scheduled for release on July 1 on the 81st anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Current president Jiang Zemin along with 70 other party and government officials will be portrayed in the movie, which also features more than 100 borrowed "Red Flag" limousines, according to local media.
Deng's legacy and the films is also likely to take on particular importance this year as the CCP readies itself for a reshuffle.
The movie plans to show Deng's role as Chinese premier during the Tiananmen Square massacre
The film gives a curt treatment of this issue in a scene where Deng meets with government officials behind closed doors about the necessity of stamping out the student movement.
Despite the controversy, Deng who died at the age of 92 is still officially revered for his contributions to China's development into one of the world's most powerful economies
an area the movie plans to highlight.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Korean Peninsula has a history of invasions, civil war, and national division.
One constant through centuries of tumult was kimchi, Korea's famous, fermented vegetable dish.
Kimchi is so pervasive in the Koreas, north and south, that enthusiasts compare it to air and water.
A museum in Seoul satisfies the appetites of those curious to know where it came from and how it evolved.
Near the din and glitter of cinemas, music stores and coffee shops, the Kimchi Field Museum sits in the upscale COEX Mall, part of a complex that hosted Asian and European leaders at a 2000 summit.
The museum first opened in another location of Seoul in 1986.
``When you think of Korea, and food, you think of kimchi,'' said Rafael Delgado, a Peruvian who toured the museum on a recent afternoon.
The staid displays don't attract droves of youths who have hipper places to go, so there's peace and space to ponder a spicy, healthy dish that is part of Korea's heritage, as well as diet.
The museum includes a library, a tasting room and a gift shop.
Experts attribute the first written reference to kimchi to Yi Kyu-bo, a Korean poet and government minister who lived from 1168 to 1241.
A copy of an original page carrying his wise words sits in a glass case.
``The leaves of turnip pickled in paste (turnip changachi) are very good to eat during the three months in summertime and the salted ones (turnip chanji) are endurable in wintertime,'' Yi wrote.
Kimchi derived from the need to preserve vegetables through the harsh Korean winters.
Today, the most popular form of dozens of varieties is made of cabbage and heavily laden with red pepper, salt, garlic and fermented shrimp and anchovies.
Cucumber, green onion and leeks are also common ingredients.
Many Korean scribes and scientists have traced the history of kimchi or studied its invigorating impact on the body, said curator Kim Joo-hee.
She collects theses for the museum, which is owned by Pulmuone Co., a South Korean company that makes kimchi and other organic food.
Koreans ate kimchi as far back as the Three Kingdoms period, prior to the establishment of the Unified Silla dynasty in 668 A.D.
A millennium ago, chefs began to experiment with a wider variety of vegetables, including Oriental parsley and Indian mustard leaf.
A culinary revolution occurred around 1700 when Koreans started using red chili peppers in kimchi, Kim said.
Koreans liked the zip of garlic, so it was easy to adapt to the new, spicy seasoning.
Portuguese traders brought the peppers to Asia and the vegetable arrived in Korea during a Japanese invasion in 1592.
One historical account says pepper powder was used as a crude form of tear gas during the fighting.
Fiery kimchi seems to match the reputation _ deserved or not _ of Koreans as headstrong, hot-tempered and high-tempo.
Such qualities helped South Koreans build one of the world's biggest economies in a few decades, even as totalitarian North Korea stubbornly spurned change despite economic ruin and political isolation.
North Korean kimchi tends to be mild and soupy, while the South Korean version is a lot punchier.
It's low in calories, and rich in vitamins.
Another breakthrough for kimchi was in the early 1900s when farmers refined the Korean cabbage seed, producing a wider, longer vegetable than the Chinese cabbage they had been growing.
A British resident of Seoul once said the red pepper-splashed cabbage folds that appear at virtually every Korean meal resemble ``used bandages.''
Most Koreans don't care how it looks, though ancient kings liked kimchi cooks to cut radishes into small, rigid cubes.
Buddhist temples serve mild kimchi.
A special, tender version is sometimes served to the elderly, in keeping with Confucian respect for seniors and their teeth.
Some people offer kimchi at memorial services for ancestors who craved the dish, though many don't because the color red is said to scare away ghosts.
The museum displays brown, glazed pots used to store kimchi in the ground during fermentation.
In the old days, some jars were cut out of logs and lined with oil-soaked paper to prevent juice leaking.
Today, factories mass-produce the dish, but nothing matches a mother's homemade kimchi.
``It's our life, like air,'' said Kim, the curator.
The hands of the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic gauge of the threat of nuclear annihilation, were moved for the first time in nearly four years because of the Sept.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which keeps the clock, set the hands at 11:53, two minutes ahead of the time it has had since 1998.
Stephen Schwartz, publisher of the Bulletin, said the board originally defined “midnight” as nuclear war.
In recent years, however, it has been redefined as the use of nuclear weapons anywhere on earth, he said.
It was the 17th time the clock has been reset since it debuted in 1947.
George A. Lopez, the publication’s chairman of the board, said it has never been moved in response to a single event.
11 attacks combined with evidence that terrorists were attempting to obtain the materials for a crude nuclear weapon should have served as a wake-up call to the world.
He said the world has focused on short-term security rather than solving long-term problems.
“The international community simply hit the snooze button rather than raising the general alarm,” Lopez said.
He said such factors as the concern about the security of nuclear weapons materials stockpiled around the world and the crisis between nuclear powers India and Pakistan also figured into the decision.
The clock is a 1-foot-square wooden mock-up in the magazine’s office at the University of Chicago.
It was started two years after the bulletin began as a newsletter among scientists of the Manhattan Project
in 1953, after the United States successfully tested the hydrogen bomb.
It has been as far away as 17 minutes, set there in 1991 in a wave of post- Cold-War optimism.
PARIS (AP) _ Rallying to salvage one of the world's most treasured troves of antiquities, UNESCO and the British Museum on April 15 announced plans to send teams of experts to Iraq to restore museums and artifacts ransacked in the aftermath of the U.S.-led invasion.
Much anger at the destruction has been directed at U.S. troops who stood by and watched it happen.
"I don't think anyone anticipated that the riches of Iraq would be looted by the people of Iraq," said U.S.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said its team would study the conditions of museums and historical sites, identify ways of restoring them and find potential donors.
UNESCO said the team would travel "when conditions permit."
About 30 experts were to meet on April 17 for an initial assessment at UNESCO headquarters in Paris.
UNESCO Director-General Koichiro Matsuura called for immediate action to protect Iraqi cultural institutions, including libraries, saying: "Culture can play a key role in the consolidation of the peace process."
In London, the British Museum said it would also send a team, and it called on the United Nations to ban the sale of antiquities looted from Iraq.
"Although we still await precise information, it is clear that a catastrophe has befallen the cultural heritage of Iraq," said British Museum director Neil MacGregor.
"We hope that the British government and the international community can move quickly to take the steps necessary to avoid further damage and to prepare the way for recovering objects looted, and for conserving those that can still be restored," he said.
After Saddam Hussein's government fell last week, looters stole and smashed priceless archaeological treasures from Iraq's National Museum.
The museum holds items of incalculable cultural value, perhaps the most famous being the tablets with Hammurabi's Code _ one of mankind's earliest codes of law.
It could not be immediately determined whether the tablets were at the museum when the war broke out.
Thieves smashed or pried open row upon row of glass cases and pilfered _ or just destroyed _ their contents.
The museum in the northern city of Mosul also was pillaged, and Baghdad's National Library, which holds one of the oldest surviving copies of the Quran, was set afire on Monday and apparently looted.
Nearby, the important library of the Religious Affairs Ministry, home to invaluable religious texts, also was looted and completely gutted by fire.
Donny George, the director of antiquities at Iraq's National Museum, told CNN on Tuesday that U.S. laxity allowed looters to come back again and again.
He said he went to the Marine headquarters in Baghdad three days ago and waited for hours to talk with a colonel about security issues.
"That day he promised that he will send armored cars to protect what's left from the museum," George said. "Three days ago till now, nobody came."
CNN reported glass cutters were found at the museum, indicating that professionals were involved in the looting.
Matsuura of UNESCO urged American and British forces to take immediate measures to guard Iraq's many archaeological sites and cultural institutions.
He also called on several groups _ countries bordering Iraq, customs officials, police and art dealers _ to do all they could to block the trading of stolen antiquities.
Kim Soo-jinm a 19-year-old female college student in Seoul, grew up watching Hollywood blockbusters, and seeing an American hero take revenge on the bad guys was always fun.
She instead has become an ardent fan of locally made films, which she says better reflect Korean interests.
Movie-goers, particularly in their teens and 20s, boosted the domestic market share of South Korean films to almost 50 percent last year as they found fresh interest in home-grown films.
Yet it is at home where the trend has been most pronounced, and where the process could go into reverse if a rule demanding a set number of Korean-language films be shown is dropped under a planned free-trade deal with the United States.
The top five grossing movies of last year were all home grown and four of them were so-called "gangster movies," whose blend of violence and slapstick comedy appealed to mainstream audiences.
Leading the pack, a male-bonding movie, "Friend," pulled in 2.6 million people in Seoul on a surge of nostalgia from the 30- and 40-something male audience.
The market last year grossed an estimated 244 billion won ($186 million), up 27 percent from a year earlier, data from the Korea Film Commission showed.
Homegrown content accounted for 46 percent of the market in 2001 compared with 32 percent the previous year.
Hollywood films took up about 47 percent of the market share, with the most popular foreign film for the year, the animated ogre-and-princess comedy "Shrek," attracting 1.1 million viewers in Seoul.
But it is not only commercial films that have made enormous strides over the past few years.
Some Korean films have become favorites at international film festivals and Korean directors have won critical acclaim.
Although it did not win a prize, it was one of the most talked-about films at the festival.
"Joint Security Area (JSA)," made by young director Park Chan-wook, won the top prize at Doville Asia Film Festival in France last year and was released in Asia.
It attracted about one million viewers in Japan last year and raked in $650,000 in the first week of its release in Hong Kong in January.
The resolution accused the North Korean government of torturing prisoners and performing public executions, as well as imposing severe restrictions on freedom of thought, assembly and women's rights, and restricting freedom of movement inside the country and across its borders.
It urged North Korea to answer all unresolved questions relating to the abduction of foreigners ``clearly and transparently.''
North Korea admitted last September it had kidnapped Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s to train its spies in Japanese language and culture.
The resolution was proposed by the European Union and co-sponsored by the United States and Japan.
China, India, Russia and Cuba were among the countries that voted against the resolution.
South Korea did not vote, while North Korea is not a member of the commission.
``The draft resolution is pursuing political purposes other than human rights,'' Li Jong-song said.
Cuba also defends North Korea, branding the resolution as ``geopolitical.''
``At the same time we are all aware that the European Union is doing this favor once again for its strategic North American ally.''
China backed North Korea's argument, charging that the commission was ``not the right venue for solving the problem of tension over the Korean peninsula.''
India abstained from voting, declaring parts of the resolution reached ``new levels of intrusiveness'' in issues which are rightfully the mandate of sovereign states.
President George W. Bush proclaimed North Korea a member of an ``axis of evil'' with Iran and Iraq, saying it was seeking weapons of mass destruction.
Since then, North Korea has pulled out of the International Atomic Energy Agency and has threatened to restart reactors stilled by a 1994 U.S.
Bush has said he wants to deal with North Korea diplomatically but has not ruled out military action.
More than $700 million in online sales were lost to fraud in 2001.
And that represented 1.14 percent of total annual online sales of $61.8 billion, according to GartnerG2, a program of business and technology research company Gartner.
Online fraud losses for 2001 were 19 times as high as fraud losses resulting from off-line sales.
And a new survey released by GartnerG2 shows that adult consumers in the United States are beginning to adopt credit card company solutions designed to protect against online fraud.
The Internet survey of more than 1,000 adult United States online consumers was conducted in January.
It showed 5.2 percent of respondents saying they'd been victimized by credit card fraud in 2001, and 1.9 percent said they'd been victimized by identity theft.
More than 18 percent of respondents said they're attempting to fight fraud by embracing two new credit card protection systems:
The credit card companies are, however, not yet willing to take the next major step:
U.S. merchants will, however, continue to pay higher fees for Internet transactions, which average approximately 2.5 percent vs.
"Consumers are interested in using these new security systems, which can significantly reduce online fraud.
The credit card companies should, however, back up their belief in these systems by lowering fees for all merchants who support them," Litan said.
"This would guarantee even more widespread adoption."
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea has made a conciliatory gesture toward South Korea, proposing high-level talks after jeopardizing planned negotiations with the United States with confusing claims about reprocessing spent nuclear fuel for possible atomic weapons.
North Korean officials on April 19 telephoned South Korean officers at the border village of Panmunjom to propose Cabinet-level talks on April 27-29 in Pyongyang.
South Korea has accepted the proposal.
The North called off a similar meeting last week.
In a message carried by the North Korean state news agency, KCNA, a Pyongyang official stressed ``the need to resourcefully settle the issue of inter-Korean relations by the nation itself through national cooperation.''
North Korea often has tried to drive a wedge between South Korea and its chief ally, the United States, by dealing with the two nations separately and saying only Koreans can resolve tensions on
There are 37,000 U.S. soldiers based in South Korea, and Seoul keeps close ties with the United States, though Washington tends to take a tougher line on North Korea.
The appeal for talks came after perplexing signals from the isolated North that left officials in Seoul and Washington wondering just what North Korea's intentions were.
On April 18, North Korea said it was reprocessing thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods at its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon.
Fuel rods are used to power nuclear power plants, and produce tiny amounts of plutonium when used.
That plutonium can be used to make bombs.
KCNA, in its English-language report, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying ``we are successfully reprocessing more than 8,000 spent fuel rods at the final phase.''
On April 20, Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he believes the North Korean statement was a mistranslation.
``There were effectively two statements released, one in Korean and one in English,'' Downer said.
Australia is one of the few Western nations with close diplomatic links with North Korea.
U.S. and South Korean officials also said there was no proof that reprocessing had begun, and suggested the vaguely worded original North Korean statement may have been mistranslated.
But the key question remains:
Is North Korea trying to arm itself with nuclear bombs, or is it just trying to raise the stakes before crucial talks with U.S. negotiators?
``We think North Korea is trying to gain leverage ahead of the talks,'' South Korea's top security adviser, Ra Jong-il, was quoted by his office as saying.
The United States, North Korea and China plan to hold talks in Beijing as early as next week to discuss Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons programs.
It would be the first opportunity for substantive U.S. discussions with Pyongyang since October, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 agreement.
A senior State Department official said on April 19 there is every expectation that the meeting in Beijing will go ahead as planned.
The official, who asked not to be identified, did not elaborate but his comment suggested the administration had concluded that North Korea had, in fact, not started reprocessing spent nuclear fuel rods.
Uneasy about Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, Washington sought talks that would include not only the North Koreans but also their neighbors _ South Korea, Japan and China.
Pyongyang insisted on one-on-one talks with Washington but agreed last week to let China sit at the negotiating table.
Intelligence experts say reprocessing spent fuel rods will enable North Korea to yield enough plutonium to build several nuclear bombs within months.
There has been a severe lack of rain and snow on the East Coast of the United States.
The amount of rain and snow that has fallen in the states from Maine to Florida has been far below normal.
The lack of rain or snow is called a drought.
The East Coast states are suffering an unusual drought this winter.
Some areas received only a small percentage of the rain they normally receive.
And the drought has continued into the winter.
Normally, drought conditions happen during hot summer weather.
Ground water supplies usually increase in the winter and decrease in the spring and summer.
Some officials worry that a dry winter could cause serious water supply problems later in the year.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studies and reports on weather and ocean conditions in the United States.
The agency says that the East Coast drought is a continuing event.
NOAA says the drought is affecting 18 percent of the United States, not including Alaska and Hawaii.
The drought reached its highest level in August, 2000, when 36 percent of the states were affected.
Weather experts say they do not know if there will be more rain or snow in the near future.
Their concerns have increased because the recent period from October to January was the second driest ever recorded for the Northeastern United States.
The Delaware River Basin Commission controls the water supply used by about twenty-million people in the New York City area and nearby states.
That agency has already begun placing limits on the use of water.
Drought warnings are in effect in many places on the East Coast.
The lack of water has caused some officials to consider ways to store water more effectively.
Now, some officials in New York are considering the same kind of system.
The state of New Jersey already has built some underground storage structures and plans to build more.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Lee Jae-gun went through North Korea's three-year training course for spies, which included swimming nonstop for eight hours and scaling hills with a 5-kilogram (11-pound) weight on each ankle and a 25-kilogram (55-pound) pack on his back.
Returning to South Korea to find his son.
Lee is one of hundreds of South Koreans who the South says were kidnapped by the communist North during decades of Cold War enmity.
He was trained in the North as a spy who would be able to infiltrate the South _ but his first chance to return and begin the search came only through a defection three decades later.
Lee, now 64, used to be a down-and-out construction hand in a Seoul slum.
After his sickly, famished wife died, leaving him with a three-month-old baby, Lee entrusted the boy to a wealthy childless couple and went to sea in 1965 at age 27.
Working on a trawler's deck was hard and dangerous, but the pay was good.
A couple more years, he thought, and he would go home and reunite with his son.
That plan was shatteredwhen his ship and another South Korean trawler were seized by North Korean patrol boats near the western sea border in April 1970 and taken to the North.
``When North Korean boats towed our ships, South Korean navy ships gave chase but it was too late,'' Lee said.
During the decades of enmity following the 1950-53 Korean War, North Korea abducted and held against their will more than 480 South Koreans, mostly fishermen, according to South Korean officials.
Pyongyang calls the allegations a smear campaign.
The fishermen are little-known victims of the Cold War.
With international attention focused on Pyongyang's suspected development of nuclear weapons, relatives and human rights activists urge their government to work harder to confirm the fishermen's fates and bring them home.
North Korea sent home 20 of the 26 fishermen kidnapped with Lee on board the two trawlers.
Lee and six young fishermen were kept and trained as spies to infiltrate the South.
Now it seemed to Lee that the only way to return home was to survive the course.
One slip of the tongue ruined Lee's plan to come to South Korea as a North Korean spy and find his son.
He says he had planned to turn himself in to Southern authorities.
``At the end of the three-year course, they told me I was ideologically unfit to become a special agent.''
Lee was sent to work at a machine tool factory.
Lee also determined to give his North Korean son a better life.
Surveillance on his family slackened in the mid-1990s amid widespread food shortages.
First his North Korean wife and son escaped to China in 1998.
Months later he followed.
With the help of South Korean activists, Lee's family traveled to Seoul in 2000.
Lee was the first South Korean fisherman in the North to return home.
But his journey has hardly ended.
Lee went to the address of his South Korean son's foster parent, but the area in Seoul had turned into apartment blocks.
His efforts to trace the foster parent by his name has also turned up nothing.
``After 30 years, Seoul has changed so much I can't tell which street is which,'' Lee said. ``There is no trace of my son.'' ex) If you park your car here the police may tow it away.
The world shipping industry's newspaper, Lloyd's List, has decided that from now on ships will lose their femininity and will be referred to as "it," not "she."
It is not known how the habit of treating ships as feminine began though it is a custom used mainly in English dominated countries.
Some believe it originates from the time ships would be dedicated to a goddess whose figure was carved on the bow.
Although women were considered to bring bad luck at sea, mariners always use the pronoun "she" when referring to their ships.
Whether its proper name is masculine, or whether it is a battleship, or a nuclear submarine, a ship is always referred to as "she."
One explanation is that a ship was nearer and dearer to the sailor than anyone except his mother.
Vessels are also known to have "sister" ships.
Naval Historical Center Web site says it is customary to classify things as feminine "especially those things which are dear to us."
Ronald Hope says the tradition of referring to sailing vessels as "she" dates back to the days of Ancient Greece.
Hope, 80, a former director of the UK-based Maritime Society, said ships have been “she” since Greek times.
"Even as recently as the 19th century most of the sea shanties referred to them as 'she' and I recall in my youth ships owners always telling stories about why a ship was like a woman.
It's a shame that it is being changed.
Peter Goodwin, curator of HMS Victory at Portsmouth, on England's south coast, said:
No ship is exactly the same and all of them have their own characteristics.
You ask any sailor and they will tell you that you care for a ship, you tend to their needs and sometimes they play you up.
But they are never an 'it'."
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea reported on April 29 its first ``probable'' case of SARS.
The infected person showed a high fever, breathing difficulties and signs of pneumonia, which qualifies him as a ``probable SARS patient,'' said Kim Moon-shik, head of the National Institute of Health.
However, Kim did not rule out the possibility that the patient could have ordinary bacterial pneumonia.
The patient, a man in his 40s, was placed in isolation at a hospital after being found to be sick upon returning from Beijing on an Air China flight on April 28, the institute said in a statement.
The man had been attending a two-month language course in the city, it said.
Four people who were sitting close to the patient have been told to stay home.
Health authorities were searching for three others who were also seated near the man, Kim said.
For weeks, South Korea has been preparing for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has gripped other parts of Asia, especially neighboring China.
There are some 15 others suspected of having the disease in South Korea.
On April 28, the government said it will forcibly quarantine people suspected of having SARS.
It expects thousands of South Korean students and business executives to return home this week fleeing the respiratory disease in China.
In Pyongyang, a North Korean health official said there was not a single confirmed SARS case in the isolated country, according to KCNA, the North's state news outlet.
The North Korean media was monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
SARS has killed more than 300 people worldwide, including more than 140 in mainland China. ex) Upon arriving home I discover the burglary.
NTT DoCoMo's research and development center has taken the first step towards development of a technology that will allow people to talk on the phone without saying a word, the company said.
Engineers are developing a sensor, which detects signals coming from the muscle movements in the cheek and jaw made when people are speaking.
The company hopes to complete the development in five years, Wada says.
This work has been part of NTT DoCoMo's R & D investigation into various styles of human interface.
The same R & D center has in the past unveiled a cell-phone design that used vibrations traveling around the body to deliver an audio signal from a transducer on the wrist to the ear.
As one of the possible applications, the sensor can be attached to a mobile handset and, with the help of a voice synthesizer, mobile-phone users can communicate in silence, Wada says.
Eventually, engineers are also hoping to apply the technology to wireless e-mail services so that typing an e-mail message will be faster and easier.
The agreement between the two Koreas was made after four days of talks in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital.
``South and North Korea will thoroughly consult each other's position on the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and will continue cooperation to resolve this issue peacefully through dialogue,'' a joint statement said.
Despite the vow, the joint statement was unlikely to mark a change in attitude by North Korea.
The North has insisted that the South should not meddle inthe nuclear standoff, calling it a dispute with the United States, according to South Korean news reports from Pyongyang.
Secretary of State Colin Powell said the United States was reviewing an offer by North Korea to give up its missiles and nuclear facilities in exchange for substantial U.S. economic benefits.
The North Koreans floated the proposal in talks with U.S. envoys in Beijing last week.
Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on April 29 that he believed North Korea exaggerated the capability of its nuclear program to maximize its negotiating position.
He said the claim ``doesn't reflect our assessment of reality or America's assessment of reality.''
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao questioned the claim that North Korea made the assertion.
He said that as far as he knew, they have ``not made such a statement.''
He added that China, which also participated in the Beijing talks, supports ``the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and also maintains the legitimate security concerns'' of North Korea should be resolved.
North Korea has demanded a nonaggression treaty with the United States.
The U.S. administration has ruled out such a move, but says some form of written security guarantee could be possible.
Powell called the Beijing meeting ``quite useful,'' but later told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that North Korea's proposal was ``not going to take us in a direction we need to go.''
Powell said he and U.S. President George W. Bush still believed a diplomatic solution was possible, and that other nations affected by North Korea's programs should be involved in the talks.
On April 29, North Korea said nuclear talks would be a waste of time if the United States insists that the communist country first scrap its suspected atomic weapons programs before discussing possible economic and diplomatic benefits.
``It is quite obvious that as long as the U.S. maintains such stand, the two sides will only waste time no matter how frequently they negotiate and such talks will not be of any help to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula,'' said a statement in Pyongyang's official newspaper Minju Joson.
``What is urgent for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue is for the U.S. to put into practice its will to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the (North),'' it said.
Bush spoke by telephone with South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun on April 29 and agreed to cooperate closely in seeking a peaceful solution to the nuclear standoff.
During the Beijing talks, U.S. officials said North Korea also claimed it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods _ a key step in producing nuclear weapons _ that could yield several more bombs within months.
But Powell said there still wasn't any evidence that North Korea had actually done so.
A maverick fertility specialist is reported to have claimed that a patient is pregnant with the world's first cloned baby.
The newspaper said he made his comments while visiting Dubai for a conference on cloning and genetic engineering.
"Our project is at a very advanced stage.
One woman among thousands of infertile couples in the programme is eight weeks pregnant."
Rudolf Jaenisch, professor of biology and a leading cloning scientist based at the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said:
"It is totally outrageous and irresponsible to attempt cloning of humans when we know there is a very high probability of severe abnormalities, even if the baby survived to birth, which is extremely doubtful."
Antinori has previously pledged to attempt to clone a baby by the end of 2001.
Richard Nicholson, editor of the UK-based Bulletin of Medical Ethics, said he was sceptical of the claim, but said if it was true the baby's future was grim.
First of all, to be manipulating human life in this way is intolerable and all civilized countries have banned it or are banning it."
"Secondly, we know the risks of producing hideously deformed creatures and loss of life associated with cloning.
It's quite irresponsible, but Antinori is a man from whom we expect this kind of behaviour."
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Yoo Si-min, a newly elected reformist lawmaker, tried something no South Korean has ever tried:
taking the oath of office without suit and tie.
It proved an uphill battle.
``Here in the Assembly, everyone wears the same identical dark suit.
I just wanted to wear comfortable clothes when I work,'' said Yoo, 44.
South Korea preserves strong conservatism, partly based on Confucianism.
Sons inherit businesses from fathers.
Most employees at businesses and government agencies address each other by their titles.
At the end of the day, they are reluctant to leave the office before their bosses.
Suit and tie is standard attire in most offices, although some businesses began tolerating casual garb
Political parties are still run as top-down organizations, although Yoo and other reformists try to break what they call ``boss politics.''
Politicians almost always wear dark suits with white dress shirts and a lawmaker's badge on the lapel.
Yoo was a student leader during the country's authoritarian rule and hosted a popular TV talk show.
Although he belongs to a group called Korea Party for Political Reform, he is a key ally of President Roh Moo-hyun, who won election last December with promises to engage communist North Korea and reform domestic politics. Using the Internet, Yoo campaigned for Roh.
When Yoo showed up for his swearing in on April 29, he was a cultural shock to many conservative lawmakers, especially those affiliated with the opposition Grand National Party, which controls the legislature.
``This is not a night club,'' one catcaller said.
Is this a market place?''
said Lee Won-chang, an opposition lawmaker.
Several lawmakers walked out in protest, accusing Yoo of ``defaming the Assembly'' and ``mistaking reform for breaking the old, respected practice.''
Despite its solemn image, the National Assembly is also a place where rival lawmakers swear at each other and scuffle
The rise of Internet and a new generation of assertive youths pouring out of schools with voting rights means that it's time for change, Yoo said.
President Roh broke the decades-old mold when he hired South Korea's first female justice minister and ministers younger than their deputies.
His culture minister, Lee Chang-dong, a former movie director, caused both criticism and praise when he showed up for work and Cabinet meetings without ties or in colored dress shirts.
Roh chats and drinks cheap ``soju'' liquor with his aides in casual attire _ something unthinkable for his predecessors.
Yoo was sworn in on April 30, this time in suit and tie.
``Because of what happened yesterday, two other newly elected lawmakers could not be sworn in,'' said Yoo's spokesman, Yang Soon-pil. Yoo doesn't want to embarrass them.''
But Yoo said he had hardly changed his view on dress code.
``I don't serve the people with clothes, I serve them with my work at the Assembly,'' Yoo said. * Before giving evidence the witness had to take an oath.
A little-known San Francisco company unveiled a personal computer that crams processor, memory, battery and storage into a package the size of a paperback novel.
When the $1,000 Ultra-Personal Computer hits stores this fall or winter, it will operate as a wireless handheld computer, akin to a Palm, OQO Inc.
Or it can be used as a "modular PC" that connects to a full-size keyboard, mouse and monitor to replace a desktop PC.
"This is a full Windows XP computer that fits in your pocket," said Colin Hunter, executive vice president of OQO.
Most people would prefer to have a computer they can carry around with them all the time."
The 5-inch by 3-inch device runs Microsoft Windows XP on a processor of up to 1 gigahertz.
It also bundles 256 megabytes of RAM, a 10 gigabyte hard drive, and two wireless networking connections.
A docking cable allows it to connect with an external keyboard, mouse and monitor.
It can also be networked to an existing PC or laptop through an Ethernet cable or wireless connection.
When undocked, the device's battery life is similar to a laptop's, at 3 ~ 8 hours, depending on use.
OQO is negotiating with electronics companies who could manufacture and market the device.
A version manufactured and sold under the OQO brand is also possible, a spokesman said.
In February, IBM announced it would license technology for a similar device, known as the MetaPad, to vendors.
IBM's MetaPad won't be ready for a few years.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ One of Korea's last princes lives out of a two-seat van packed with books, laundry and an electronic range.
He used to sing at night clubs for American GIs and sleeps in flophouses.
Yet he's so proud of his blood line that he never sheds his clothes in a public bathhouse when others are around.
``If I die, there will be no one left to tell the stories of the last royal family,'' Yi says.
South Korea is proud of its heritage, which includes the invention of the Korean alphabet during the Yi Dynasty.
Historical dramas about romance and bloody coups at the ancient royal court are a TV staple.
But few in South Korea know the names or whereabouts of relatives of the Yi Dynasty's last king.
Koreans accuse the dynasty's last rulers of incompetence and blame them for Korea's humiliating 35-year subjugation to Japanese rule.
``But with all its achievements and failures, the royal family deserves better treatment.''
Although a few hard-core supporters demand that South Korea switch to a monarchy, Yi considers such demands unrealistic.
Instead, he believes the government should let him live in a palace, ``at least as a tourist attraction.''
The government is not considering Yi's request, citing public skepticism.
Yi Seok also wants to build a museum where people learn about the dress, food and rules of etiquette at the royal court.
Four years ago, he established a ``National Federation for Preserving the Great Korean Royal Court'' _ an organization operating mainly out of his van.
He runs a Web site and claims thousands of members who are asked to pay at least 1,000 won (83 cents) a month.
``Your Highness, I have always wondered about you ... Now that I know you are alive, I am brimming with tears of happiness.''
``An 80-year-old man called me the other day, offering to come up to Seoul just to bow before me.''
Most are unaware of Yi's campaign.
``I both feel sympathy and anger at the last king and his family,'' said Kim Jae-chun, a taxi driver. ``I understand why people do not want to think about the subject.
It's embarrassing history.''
Yi speaks with a polite yet authoritative tone.
He wears clean, ironed suits and combs his hair before posing for photos.
The Yi Dynasty crumbled during the reign of Yi Seok's grandfather, King Kojong, when great nations jockeyed for control of Korea.
Rival court factions shifted to Chinese, Russian and Japanese forces and the intrigue led to the assassination of the queen by Japanese troops.
Kojong had dozens of grandchildren.
Of them, Yi Seok is the only grandson living in South Korea.
All his elder brothers are dead.
Two younger brothers run auto repair and liquor shops in the United States.
He also has two sisters in the United States and three in South Korea.
A 74-year-old son of Yi Seok's uncle, who was taken to Japan as hostage and forced to marry a Japanese woman, lives in Japan.
Some royal clansmen consider him the first in line to the throne, but most Koreans do not treat him as such, feeling insulted that a Korean prince was born to a Japanese mother.
President Syngman Rhee, who founded South Korea in 1948 after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, let Lee Seok's family live in one of the several royal palaces in Seoul, but confiscated its vast assets.
He saw the royal family as a potential threat to his authoritarian rule.
``We still had court ladies who followed me everywhere,'' Yi says with a chuckle. ``They would plead to me not to run because running was beneath a prince's dignity.''
According to the court's customs, his mother referred to Yi Seok as ``Your Highness!''
``My high school friends found that strange,'' he says.
When the military rulers in the 1960s deprived Yi's family of financial allowances, he worked as a disk jockey.
In 1962, he began singing at night clubs, entertaining American GIs with such songs as ``I Left My Heart In San Francisco.''
``An aunt learned about this and she wept and lamented that a Korean prince became a 'clown,' but I had to make a living.''
Yi Seok enjoyed national fame with a 1970s hit ``A House of Doves,'' a melodic song about a happy family.
But he was forced to emigrate to the United States when Maj. Chun Doo-hwan took power in a coup in 1979 and evicted Yi's family from the royal palace.
Overstaying his American visa, Yi mowed lawns, cleaned swimming pools and worked as an armed guard in a liquor store in the Los Angeles area.
After securing a green card, he ran his own liquor store.
He returned home in 1989.
So I went to my old home, the palace, but guards there would not let me in.
I jumped the walls at night to sleep in there, but the place was too damp when unheated,'' he says.
Yi had three short-lived marriages.
He has two daughters and a son, all born to different mothers.
Recently a sympathetic landlord let Yi Seok temporarily use a small office.
Scattered about are unpacked boxes.

It's just that the gap is narrowing, said gerontologist Dr.
William Hazzard, a professor of medicine at University of Washington in Seattle.
By 1990, women outlived men by seven years, and now there is about a five-year gap, he said.
“The happy fact is not that women are losing life,” said Dr.
Robert Butler, head of the International Longevity Center.
In fact, the centenarian club is still vastly female: 80 percent of the 37,306 Americans age 100 or over are women.
Men are five to six times more likely to have a heart attack than women right up to the age of menopause.
By the time they hit 80, the gap has narrowed, but the risk is still 20 percent higher in men.
“It's not whether they'll die of heart disease, but when.
And they're dying at an older age.”
Similarly, men are disproportionately reaping the benefits of declines in smoking and of eating less fat, especially saturated fat, than 30 or 40 years go, he said.
High blood pressure is being diagnosed and treated earlier and again, because men had a greater risk of developing hypertension to begin with, they get greater benefits.
No one knows for sure what the maximum lifespan will be, but according to Hazzard, the burden is on those that say we'll live to be older than 85 on average.
That's where the ceiling effect comes in.
Since the average women already lives to be over 80, while the average man lives to be about 75, women are slowing in their rate of increase because they are so close to the limit.
“We're already seeing some of the benefits:
less widowhood, fewer elderly people in nursing homes and the increased social support of both spouses being alive longer.”
As if she wasn't ubiquitous enough, Britney Spears' music will be available this summer on a new type of disc for small handheld players.
The discs look like CDs an inch (2.5 centimeters) across and are housed in plastic cartridges.
They can store any kind of data, including video and software and are attractive to the music industry because they are strong on copyright protection.
While the format is novel, analysts say getting consumers to adopt it will be a tough sell for consumer electronics and record companies.

The discs will cost about $16 when they are released in stores in early June, with one album of music ready to play.
But because the discs pack data densely and the music is compressed using methods similar to that of MP3 software, each can contain up to five albums of music.
The extra disc space can contain videos and lyrics, accessed by connecting a Dataplay player to a computer.
When connected, a user can also store data on the discs
250 megabytes on each side, for a total slightly less than the 650 megabytes that fit on a CD.
Data can only be written to the discs, not erased.
Other partner companies plan to incorporate Dataplay discs in digital cameras and small handheld movie viewers, to be released later this year.
A disc can store a two-hour movie at a low resolution suitable for small screens.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Roh Moo-hyun will fly to the United States this weekend to tackle two of his toughest hurdles:
resolving the North Korean nuclear threat and reducing his country's decades-old reliance on the U.S. military.
Roh's weeklong trip, which begins on May 11, comes amid heightened tensions over North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and rising calls in Washington for the United States to cut its troops presence in South Korea.
Finding a mutually acceptable way of defusing the North Korean nuclear crisis will be the key topic of the May 14 White House summit between U.S.
President George W. Bush and Roh, both known for being plainspoken about their views on the government in Pyongyang.
In a meeting in Beijing in late April, North Korea gave U.S. negotiators a long wish list of political and economic benefits it wants to get in return for giving up its nuclear ambitions, according to U.S. officials.
Washington is reviewing the proposal with its allies in Japan and South Korea.
``The outline of how we will respond will become clear after the South Korea-U.S. summit,'' Ra Jong-il, national security adviser for Roh, said on May 6.
Since his election last December, Roh has tirelessly called for reconciliation with North Korea and a peaceful solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis.
Bush says he seeks a peaceful solution too, but he pulls no punches when criticizing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, whom he accuses of ``blackmailing'' the outside world and starving his people while pursuing weapons of mass destruction.
U.S. officials have not ruled out the military option.
The nuclear dispute flared in October when Washington said North Korea admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 treaty.
During the Beijing talks, U.S. officials say, North Korea claimed it already has nuclear weapons and that it had reprocessed spent nuclear fuel rods for more weapons materials.
Secretary of State Colin Powell said impoverished North Korea can count oncurbs nuclear weapons programs and missile exports as well as other activities such as drug trafficking.
Roh's trip to Washington comes at a sensitive time in the U.S.
-South Korean alliance, forged during the 1950-53 Korean War.
By October, the Pentagon is likely to decide on a major realignment _ and perhaps a substantial withdrawal _ of forces in South Korea.
Several months ago, thousands of South Koreans held street rallies to protest the deaths of two girls hit by a U.S. military vehicle and call for more South Korean jurisdiction over U.S. troops.
While tension rose in the nuclear standoff, however, thousands of South Koreans also rallied in support of the U.S. military presence.
In a TV debate show on May 1, Roh said it was time for South Korea to reduce its dependence on the U.S. military.
``Some people seem to think, 'We will all die if we don't have the U.S. military.'
But Roh complained that the United States and South Korea were ``out of step'' with each other over when to pull back U.S. troops deployed close to the border with North Korea.

LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A federal grand jury indicted on May 8 alleged Chinese double agent Katrina Leung on charges that she illegally took, copied and kept secret documents obtained from an FBI agent who was her chief contact and alleged lover.
The five-count indictment, however, did not charge Leung, 49, with espionage.
She has been jailed without bond since her April 9 arrest.
He was charged with wire fraud for allegedly filing false reports to FBI headquarters about Leung's reliability and with gross negligence for allegedly allowing her access to classified material.
Leung's indictment was immediately denounced by her husband, Kam Leung, who noted that a second retired FBI agent has admitted an affair with his wife.
``I want to emphasize that for over 20 years she was under the strict supervision of the FBI,'' Kam Leung told reporters outside their elegant home in wealthy San Marino.
He added, ``We all love her and look forward to the day we can welcome her back.''
Defense attorney Janet Levine said the treatment of her client was ``insulting, degrading and sexist.''
She denounced the government for portraying Katrina Leung as a Chinese Mata Hari and said that the woman was convinced to keep working for the FBI even when she wanted to end their association.
``They appealed to her patriotism, her love for this country ... she was begged by her FBI handlers to stay on.''
She said that at some point the FBI knew that the Chinese had identified her as an American agent.
``The FBI played a dangerous game knowing that Katrina was the one in harm's way if something went wrong,'' Levine said.
Calls seeking comment from two assistant U.S. attorneys involved in the case were not immediately returned.
Smith's attorney, Brian Sun, also has insisted on his client's innocence.
Prosecutors say Leung, a valuable FBI source of Chinese intelligence for 18 years, was simultaneously passing secret information obtained from Smith to China.
The breach has raised questions about every Chinese FBI counterintelligence investigation or operation from 1982 to 2000.
Leung, a socialite and political activist, was paid $1.7 million by the FBI for her information as an intelligence asset code-named ``Parlor Maid.''
The indictment against Leung charges her with two counts of copying classified documents with the intent to use them to benefit a foreign nation.
The documents were allegedly taken from Smith when he visited Leung at her home.
One document contains details of ``Royal Tourist,'' an FBI investigation into Peter Lee, a TRW Inc. employee who pleaded guilty to spying for China in 1997.
Another document is described only as a June 1997 secret FBI electronic communication.
The other three charges say Leung kept those documents without authorization, as well as another document detailing FBI intercepts of Leung's conversations with her Chinese intelligence contact, known only as ``Mao.''
Leung faces up to 50 years in prison if convicted on all counts, while Smith faces up to 40 years behind bars.
The indictment against Smith stressed the impropriety of the relationship and said the agent should have disclosed it in the 19 reports he filed with FBI headquarters about her.
Leung claimed contacts with some 2,100 Chinese officials and frequently visited China, where she was often seen with high-ranking government officials.
The FBI said it learned in 1991 that she had passed information to a Chinese intelligence officer but the matter was left to Smith to handle.
In his subsequent reports to FBI headquarters, Smith allegedly vouched for the validity of her information and said she had been verified in part by use of a lie detector.
In fact, Leung refused to take a lie detector test.
ex) I have a useful contact in New York.
ex) We're so much looking forward to seeing you again.
Belgium has become the second country in Europe after the Netherlands to decriminalise euthanasia.
The lower house of parliament passed a controversial bill that gives patients the right to die.
After two days of heated debate, the lower chamber voted 86-51 in favour, with 10 abstentions.
The result is widely expected following approval of the bill by the Belgian Senate in October.
"Everyone has the right to die in dignity," Anne-Mie Descheemaeker of the Flemish Green Party told Reuters.
"People aren't afraid of being dead but they fear the process of dying.
I'm sure that having the option of euthanasia actually gives people the courage to go on day after day."
Martine Dardenne of the Green Party, told Reuters before the vote:
"People should be given the right to choose.
I don't see why one group should impose its moral view on another."
The Netherlands became the first country in the world to allow a patient's right-to-die when it passed its euthanasia law in April.
The bill allows doctors to kill patients with terminal diseases who are suffering "unbearably" if they request it.
The Belgian law differs from Dutch legislation in that it applies to patients older than 18 and sets different procedures for patients who are terminally ill and those who may have incurable diseases but still have years to live.
Any patient requesting euthanasia must be conscious when he makes his demand and must repeat his request.
In the case of someone who is not in the terminal stages of illness, a third medical opinion must be sought.
Every mercy killing case must be filed at a special commission that would decide if the doctors in charge have obeyed regulations.
The law, under consideration now for more than a year, has divided political parties with the Christian Democrats staunchly opposed to legislation and the Socialist-Liberal-Green coalition supporting it.
"We stand against it because it's an extreme law.
It does not contain any provision against abuse," said Yves Leterme of the Christian Democrats.
Some members of the rainbow coalition parties also voiced their objections.
Paralysed, incontinent and unable to speak, she died earlier this week after suffering breathing difficulties and slipping into a coma.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hundreds of truck drivers refused to return to work on May 13 despite the South Korean government's threat to use the police to end a five-day strike that has crippled the world's third-busiest port.
Prime Minister Goh Kun said the strike ``was seriously damaging the economy'' because the Pusan port handles 80 percent of all container traffic in and out of South Korea, the world's 11th largest economy.
``The people will understand why the government will have to send in law-enforcement forces.''
Goh said the government will continue to mediate talks, but said it cannot wait long.
About 6,000 police were on standby.
In talks mediated by the government, the Korean Cargo Workers Federation and transportation companies met but failed to resolve the dispute over demands by the drivers for higher pay and lower fuel taxes.
Samsung Electronics Co., the world's biggest maker of computer memory chips, said it stands to lose roughly 100 billion won (US$83million) in revenue a day if operations in Pusan continue to be disrupted by a strike.
``If this strike is prolonged, it could be a significant problem for Samsung and other major exporters,’’ Samsung Electronics spokesman James Chung said.
LG Electronics, South Korea's largest home appliance maker, said some shipments have been disrupted by the strike.
More than 60 percent of the company's revenue is derived from exports.
About 700 drivers were taking part in the strike.
The action in Pusan comes after another group of truck drivers in the major industrial city of Pohang ended a weeklong strike on May 9 when transportation companies agreed to raise their fees.
The strike had caused delivery problems for major steel makers, including Pohang-based POSCO, one of the world's largest steel mills, as drivers prevented nonunion vehicles from entering
``However, if the issue is not resolved through dialogue, and should there be a possibility of a transportation crisis, Roh issued an instruction for a strict implementation of law on any violations,'' said Lee Hae-sung, Roh's senior secretary for public information.
Union members in Incheon, a major port city west of Seoul, have also threatened to strike beginning Monday.
Scientists have discovered evidence that hordes of dark, miniature galaxies surround ordinary galaxies, lending credence to the theory that the universe is comprised mostly of cold, dark matter.
The astronomers, who describe their work in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal, based their finding on an in-depth study of light from distant galaxies.
"The lack of observed satellite galaxies around large galaxies has been major point in the prosecution of the case against cold dark matter," said one of the researchers, Neal Dalal of the University of California, San Diego.
"Our research can be regarded as a major vindication of the model."
WASHINGTON (AP) _ President George W. Bush and newly elected South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun agreed on May 14 that the Korean Peninsula should be nuclear-weapons free and that the current standoff with North Korea should be achieved through peaceful means.
``We're making good progress toward achieving that peaceful
Roh, who in the past has urged the United States against slapping economic sanctions on the North or considering military force, said that he came to his meeting with Bush with ``both concerns and hopes in my mind,'' but that Bush had dispelled the concerns.
``Now I return to Korea with only hopes in my mind,'' Roh said.
``Escalatory moves by North Korea will only lead to its greater isolation and a more desperate situation in the North,'' their statement said.
It was the first time the two leaders had met face to face, although Bush said they had several phone conversations.
``I have found the president to be an easy man to talk to.
He expresses his opinions clearly and he's easy to understan,'' Bush said.
Bush said they also discussed economic issues.
confidence that South Korea ``will continue to be an engine for economic growth and vitality.''
The two leaders spoke briefly from a podium set up in the Rose Garden, which was bright with late-day sunlight, then turned without taking questions to the residence portion of the White House for dinner.
In their joint statement, the two leaders welcomed China's role in hosting a three-way meeting last month that included the North and the United States.
But the statement also suggested that subsequent talks should also include South Korea and Japan.
``Russia and other nations can also play a constructive role,''
``President Roh and President Bush reaffirmed that they will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea,'' the statement said.
Earlier, Roh appealed to the United States against any rush to a decision to reposition the 37,000 U.S. troops now stationed in South Korea.
His office said in a statement that Cheney told Roh over lunch that ``U.S. troops should stay in South Korea because they guarantee security in the region.''
U.S. officials did not dispute the account.
There have been increasing public demonstrations in South Korea against the U.S. military presence.
Years ago, Roh demanded that U.S. troops leave but now he is seeking to delay U.S. proposals to move troops away from the Demilitarized Zone, which separates the two Koreas.
Roh told Cheney, ``I understand the principle and necessity of relocation of American forces in South Korea.'' But, he added, such a ``realignment of U.S. forces affects Korean politics and the economy,'' according to the South Korean statement.
``There has to be close coordination between the U.S. and South Korea on this subject,'' Roh was quoted as saying.
Bush and Roh both are emphasizing a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear standoff.
South Korea and the United States agree that North Korea must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons, but their approaches differ.
administration is wary of negotiating with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, with top Bush advisers divided internally on whether to pursue a policy of containment or increased dialogue.

NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft has reportedly detected water ice under the surface of the red planet, a finding that could be a giant step in exploration of Mars.
Many astronomers believe Mars used to have quantities of liquid water on its surface, but they have never agreed on where the water went.
Liquid water is seen as a prerequisite for Earth-type life on a planet.
Underground water ice could be a key to understanding how Mars developed and could inform future exploratory missions.
While full technical details will not be made public until late this week, the detection of sub-surface water ice on Mars is just what Mars Odyssey was sent into space to investigate.
Odyssey is also recording data on radiation in low orbit around Mars, to determine any radiation-related risk to future human explorers.
Mars is one of the most studied objects in our solar system.
As Earth's next-door planetary neighbour, it has the advantage of location and is also thought to be similar in composition to Earth, rather than being a gas giant like Jupiter.
In addition to Mars Odyssey, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is also collecting data with the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which has recently taken pictures of dust storms on the Martian surface.
The movie, ``Arirang,'' is a remake of a film based on a classic nationalistic tale that depicts Korean resistance to Japanese colonialists, who occupied the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.
It was first made as a silent black-and-white movie in 1926 and then remade several times in both Koreas.
But Arirang's upcoming debut in Pyongyang marks the first time that a South Korean movie has been publicly screened in the North since the 1950-53 Korean War.
South Korean Lee Doo-yong, who directed the latest film version,said he took his version of Arirang to North Korea in October, and censors there agreed to screen it in two cinemas in Pyongyang from May 23.
Admission to the movie will be free.
It is set to open in Seoul at the same time.
South Korean films have had limited private screenings in the North, but this is the first time one has been released to the public there, Lee and a North Korean cultural expert with South Korea's Unification Ministry said.
``The film shows the happiness and sadness of life.
``It will be good for reconciliation if we can encourage more cultural exchanges like this.''
Young-jin runs around his rural hometown, attacking all those who work or collude with the Japanese.
He regains his sanity to battle a Japanese spy who tries to rape his sister _ but later loses his freedom forever, Lee said.
Stories about resistance to Japanese colonialism are popular in North Korea.
The nation's late founder and first president, Kim Il-sung, led pro-independence guerrillas.
His son, Kim Jong-il, rules the country today and its state-controlled media often publish diatribes accusing Tokyo of failing to make amends for its repressive occupation.
North Korean films have occasionally been screened in the South,though most have flopped at the box office.
The first was in 2000 with a film called ``Pulgasari,'' a North Korean version of ``Godzilla.''
Though the film was made in the North, its director, Shin Sang-ok, was South Korean.
He sought asylum in the United States in 1986, shortly before the film was finished, and said he and his wife had been kidnapped and held for several years to make movies for Kim
Kim Jong-il founded a film school in Pyongyang that has become a routine stop for the country's few foreign visitors.
Aside from a few movies based on legends, or old stories, most North Korean films advertise the totalitarian government and its socialist creed.
Arirang's director Lee said he wasn't overly concerned about being kidnapped when he visited the North for a week last year.
But I must admit I was a little nervous when entering Pyongyang.
ex) We were all set to go when the telephone rang.
ex) We must try to curtail our spending.
ex) I am not overly impressed by his work.
Millions of computers are being thrown on scrapheaps across Europe, creating a high-tech hazard for the environment.
Many people across the continent are using more than one computer every day
at the office, at home or on the move with a laptop or a pocket PC.
And as technology develops and the marketing machines go into overdrive, customers are buying better, faster and sleeker machines and discarding the old ones with the rest of the household rubbish.
A PC has an average lifecycle of just over two years.
Moore's law, named in the 1970s after chip-guru Charles Moore, states that the speed and power of computer processors, powered by silicon chips, doubles every 18 months.
So any electronic device armed with a chip ages quickly.
This is good news for computer manufacturers and retailers, but bad news for the "green screen" lobby.
Many computer users take their old machine straight to the scrapheap because they do not know it could have an afterlife.
But some businesses have gone into recycling.
Hardware company Dell has a second-hand exchange scheme in the United States where customers cover the cost of shipping.
Dell wants to extend this to Europe.
The European Union is also laying out recycling rules for all electronic devices.
It wants manufacturers to be responsible for recycling and take back old machines when they sell new models.
There are other ways to ensure your computer is given a graceful retirement, including donating it to schools.
Despite all the efforts, analysts say most computers in Europe and America are not recycled but scrapped.
In America, the pile of discarded machines would weigh about 220 million tons, says the U.S.
NEW YORK (AP) _ In a flurry of red, white and blue balloons, streamers and confetti, Broadway bid goodbye to ``Les Miserables.''
It was an emotional final performance for the musical, which closed on May 18 after more than 16 years and 6,680 performances, second only to ``Cats,'' Broadway's longest-running show.
Even before the show reached its stirring finale, the invitation-only audience was on its feet and cheering the performers.
``Time for au revoir,'' producer Cameron Mackintosh told the audience at the curtain call as he thanked the cast and ``all the great, fantastic casts we've had before.''
The show's authors, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, as well as its co-directors, Trevor Nunn and John Caird, stood beside him beaming.
After the curtain call and speeches, some 40 children who had appeared in recent high school productions of ``Les Miserables'' gave mini-reprises of the show's better-known songs.
They were joined on stage by all the performers, including members of the original cast, for one last bow.
The English-language version of ``Les Miserables,'' which tells the story of Jean Valjean and his pursuit by the relentless Inspector Javert, had its premiere in London at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Barbican Theatre in October 1985 and moved that December to the Palace Theatre, where it is still running.
Success has not been limited to New York and London.
The musical has played around the world, from Asia to Australia to South America, grossing more than $1.8 billion worldwide.
11 terrorist attacks, ticket sales for the New York show faltered.
In the last several weeks, the musical has played to more than 90 percent capacity.
The week before its final seven days in New York, ``Les Miserables'' grossed $853,505, filling nearly 96 percents of its seats.
In the last few years, the big British musicals have slowly been disappearing from Broadway.
``Cats,'' the Andrew Lloyd Webber feline extravaganza, folded in 2000 after 18 years and 7,485 performances. ``Miss Saigon,'' another Boublil-Schonberg show, closed in January 2001 after a 10-year run.

Next week, a traditional national council called a loya jirga will meet in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul.
About 1,500 delegates will choose a new leader for Afghanistan and a temporary government.
The loya jirga tradition began hundreds of years ago.
Tribal leaders from all over Afghanistan would be called together to accept or reject national policies, to settle disputes between tribes or to consider new constitutions.
Most loya jirgas in the past have been all male.
The loya jirga is a temporary decision-making group.
It is not a permanent part of the Afghan government.
The loya jirga is a representative process although it is not considered fully democratic.
Representatives of the most honored or most powerful Afghan families choose the people who elect loya jirga members.
The current loya jirga process began in December of last year.
Afghan groups agreed to set up a six-month government following the ousting of Taleban rulers.
That agreement also called for an emergency loya jirga to be held at the end of the six-month term to appoint a longer-term temporary government.
In January, Afghanistan appointed an independent committee to establish rules and methods for the loya jirga.
The committee had to decide on a process for choosing loya jirga members.
It also had to make sure that women and minorities had representation on the loya jirga.
160 seats were guaranteed for female delegates.
The process of choosing loya jirga members has gone through several steps.
The number of electors for an area was based on population.
Then, last week, the electors went to Kandahar for the final voting.
They chose the final group of loya jirga members from among themselves.
The process was not free of problems.
There were reports of vote-buying.
There also were reports that electors had been threatened.
There were delays in the voting as well.
Afghanistan’s former King Mohammad Zahir Shah will open the loya jirga Monday.
He returned to the country recently after living in exile for more than twenty years.
Zahir Shah ruled Afghanistan for forty years and is still considered influential with many Afghans.
However, his part in the loya jirga is ceremonial.
The loya jirga is to complete its work by June sixteenth.
Many experts believe it will choose Hamid Karzai, the current temporary leader of Afghanistan, as its next leader.
Karzai says he will accept the position if it is offered.
The new temporary leader and government of Afghanistan will serve for two years.
Then the country hopes to hold free and fair elections to choose a fully representative government.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Internet has spawned a new type of journalism in highly wired South Korea _ an increasingly popular Web site where doctors, students and even housekeepers work as ``citizen reporters.''
The three-year-old online service ``Ohmynews’’ _ where the public reports on everything from local gossip to national politics _ has become such a high-profile news outlet that Roh Moo-hyun granted it his first interview after being inaugurated as president in February.
``With Ohmynews, we wanted to say goodbye to 20th century journalism where people only saw things through the eyes of the mainstream, conservative media,'' said its editor and founder Oh Yeon-ho.
We put everything out there and people judge the truth for themselves.''
But Ohmynews's methods have raised concerns about the quality and objectivity of its reporting which, according to its own figures, is read by an estimated 1.2 million people daily.
``Marketing people and activists can pose as journalists to promote their own products and ideas,'' said Choi Joon-suk, a senior editor at South Korea's largest printed newspaper, Chosun Ilbo. ``The quality of the online media is a huge problem.''
All stories are fact checked and edited by professional reporters before being pasted onto the Internet, he said.
Only two stories have led to defamation cases.
A check of his computer shows 26,310 readers have registered to be citizen reporters.
They write about 200 stories a day.
Ohmynews last week published a string of articles ranging from Roh's trip to Washington to discuss the North Korean nuclear crisis to some more local matters.
One citizen reporter wrote a story alleging the nephew of a provincial city mayor illegally drew a loan from a farmers' cooperative.
Another wrote a first-person account of her husband preparing her a birthday breakfast.
``Yesterday was my birthday.
My darling husband got up early and I could hear him bustling about in the kitchen preparing the breakfast for me...''
About 80 percent of the electronic newspaper's content comes from the public, the balance from Ohmynews's team of 38 professional reporters and editors.
Pay for a citizen's article ranges from nothing to US$16, depending on its importance.
Ohmynews's influence was highlighted after an American military armored vehicle ran down and killed two South Korean schoolgirls last June.
While the accident initially attracted relatively little attention in the mainstream press, Ohmynews was aggressive in its coverage.
The stories prompted one ``citizen reporter'' to call for protests.
The idea snowballed and South Korea experienced some of its largest anti-U.S. demonstrations in years and critics called for a review of the U.S.
Mainstream newspapers later criticized Ohmynews, questioning whether it was ethical for a so-called reporter to incite demonstrations.
Then a few months later during campaigning for the presidential elections, Ohmynews coverage caught the attention of many 20_ and 30-year-olds.
They united behind Roh Moo-hyun and his policies for a more balanced relationship between Seoul and Washington and conciliation with communist North Korea.
The fast rise in popularity of Ohmynews, and other online news services, is partly attributable to the 70 percent penetration of homes with high-speed broadband Internet access connections _ more than anywhere else in the world.
Paik Hak-soon, a political observer at the Sejong Institute research center, said ``the mainstream press still has the ear of the majority of the public. But things are changing.''
``Twenty and thirty year-olds are getting their news from the Internet,'' he said.
A breakthrough in stem cell research in Australia could hold a key to the treatment of cancers, AIDS and other auto-immune diseases.
A team from the Monash University Medical School in Melbourne, Victoria, have identified and grown stem cells to regenerate the thymus
The thymus produces many of the cells that make up the body's immune system, including the infection-fighting T-cells.
Stem cells are cells which can be manipulated by scientists to grow into specific parts of a body.
While the Australian scientists have only managed to grow a mouse's thymus so far, they believe a human thymus could be produced from stem cells in three to five years.
that might develop from this research could be at least 10 years away.
Apart from potentially being able to treat or regrow an ailing thymus, Gill says the better understanding of how the thymus and immune system cells works will most likely lead to better disease treatments.
Up until now, it had not been known which cells lead to the creation of the crucial epithelium part of the thymus.
The epithelium converts other stem cells into T-cells.
It also controls the ability of T-cells to recognize invaders in the body and helps prevent T-cells from attacking healthy body tissues.
But thymus activity reduces after puberty.
The Monash research could lead to the discovery of how the thymus can be stimulated to renew the production of immune system cells.
This could lead to treatments for conditions where T-cells have been depleted, such as AIDS, and after chemotherapy.
The Monash team has isolated a population of epithelium stem cell markers in a mouse thymus and proved that they can be grown into a fully functioning thymus.
The next part of the research will be identifying and isolating epithelium stem cells from a human thymus.
Researchers at Monash University in the southern State of Victoria are amongst the world leaders in many fields of stem cell research
a leadership which has developed out of earlier pioneering work in in-vitro fertilization.
Sir Hillary, 83, with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay who died in 1986, was the first to scale the world's highest mountain, reaching the summit on May 29, 1953.
Fifty years later every New Zealander can recall with pride Hillary's earthy words:
When the achievement was announced on the steps of New Zealand's parliament a couple of days later, acting Prime Minister Keith Holyoake said Hillary ``has put the British race and New Zealand on top of the world.''
Five decades later, now firmly in the Pacific and beyond British Empire, New Zealanders would cringe at that.
It was not so much the achievement of being first to the top of the world, but the manner in which Hillary handled the fame.
He built schools and hospitals, created organizations such as the Himalayan Trust and worked tirelessly for primarily the Nepalese, but also for Third World causes.
People in places like Nepal, he said, no more asked to live in poverty than New Zealanders were responsible for their affluence.
``The fact that we do is a blessing, and with it comes responsibilities,'' he said.
In the decades since Everest more than a few New Zealanders have headed off into unpaid labor around the Third World, inspired by Hillary's service.
``That climb 50 years ago had a big effect on the way we New Zealanders regarded ourselves and our country,'' Prime Minister Helen Clark said at a recent Parliamentary reception.
``It was a triumph of skill, courage and endurance in which, as a nation, New Zealand took enormous pride...
''In the 50 years since, Sir Edmund has shown us that the achievement of one dream can be the basis for new aspirations.
Hillary replied in a familiar fashion:
''I like to think that I am a very ordinary New Zealander, not terribly bright perhaps but determined and practical in what I do.
''It's true,`` he told AFP, ''I think he was everything we thought a decent New Zealander ought to be.
``He got on with it, he knocked the bugger off, he did kindly good works in Nepal, he could turn his hand to being high commissioner in Delhi, but above all he remained good old Ed, unpretentious and decent...
He gave us a feeling about ourselves that perhaps pre-June 1953 we did not have.''
Hensley said that when Holyoake made his ``British race'' remark it was only because the notion of ``New Zealand citizenship'' at that stage was only five years old.
He was a New Zealander who had what we liked to think, was the best New Zealand virtues and, look at that, he was internationally admired.''
Hensley recalled meeting Hillary around the world.
``The impressive thing about Ed Hillary was that he was always Ed.
what you saw was what you got, whether he was high commissioner in Delhi or running the legendary bees...
''War has probably shaped us more than any other single thing from our landscape, but the mystique of Ed is a more cheerful counter to our other experiences.
During the early 1980s then prime minister Rob Muldoon and Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi had such a bad that New Zealand closed its mission in New Delhi.
In 1984 newly elected prime minister David Lange named Hillary Wellington's envoy to India and Nepal and he turned things around.
There is something of an after-dinner joke here.
It goes, ''What do Bill Clinton and New Zealand have in common?
They both owe their reputations to Hillary.
An asteroid the size of a football field passed extremely close to Earth last week but it remained undetected until days later, according to astronomers.
The space rock missed our planet by only 75,000 miles, about one-third the distance to the moon, making the near collision one of the closest ever recorded.
Cruising at 6.2 miles per second, the big boulder could have unleashed some major firepower had it struck, according to the NEO (Near Earth Objects) Information Center in Leicester, England.
The destructive force might have been comparable to an asteroid or comet that exploded over Siberia in 1908, which flattened 77 square miles of trees, according to the NEO.
But the asteroid, designated 2002 MN, is not in the same league as potential killer rocks measuring more than 0.6 miles in diameter, some of which are known to lurk in our space neighborhood between Mars and Venus.
Nevertheless, the big boulder should not pose a risk for some time.
"We have calculated its orbit several decades into the future and it does not threaten Earth."
The closest near collision in recent decades took place in 1994, when asteroid 1994XL1 passed within 65,000 miles of our planet.
CANNES, France (AP) _ Director Gus Van Sant's, 50, ``Elephant,'' an intimate look at the victims and killers in a fictional shooting at an American high school, won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.
The film was well-received, though the victory Sunday was something of a surprise.
The French Riviera festival's 12-day lineup was considered the weakest in recent memory, and many critics favored Lars von Trier's dark, challenging drama ``Dogville,'' which did not win any prizes.
Van Sant, best known for ``Good Will Hunting,'' loosely based some aspects of his film on the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in suburban Denver.
For Van Sant, the film harks back to the small, lower-budget movies he once made, like ``My Own Private Idaho.''
He shot the film in just 20 days with a cast of real high school students, not actors.
The movie starts out showing an ordinary school day, with (a group of) students gossiping in the cafeteria, playing football or working in the photography lab.
Two students go on a shooting spree in the hallways.
The American director looked somewhat surprised as he accepted the Palme d'Or, saying ``Vive la France!''
While newspapers have given lots of attention to school violence, ``drama is an area where we're not supposed to really be talking about such things, because it is such a large problem,'' Van Sant said.
The title, ``Elephant,'' refers to the old expression about a problem that's as easy to ignore as an elephant in the living room.
``It's easier to leave it sleeping and not aggravate it,'' he said.
The director was the first American to take the Palme d'Or since Quentin Tarantino won for ``Pulp Fiction'' in 1994.
Van Sant also won the prize for best director.
``Uzak,'' (Distant), a slow-moving Turkish film about a jobless man from the countryside who irritates his sophisticated city cousin by moving into his apartment, won the Grand Prize, or second place.
The film's two stars, Muzaffer Ozdemir and Mehmet Emin Toprak, shared the award for best actor.
They played the two cousins, who were both lonely and alienated, but unable to become friends.
Arcand also directed the film about a womanizing university professor who confronts death with humor and sharp intelligence.
The movie had many viewers wiping away tears.
Marie-Josee Croze, who plays a young drug addict recruited to supply the dying man with heroin to ease his pain, won the award for best actress.
The Jury Prize went to ``At Five in the Afternoon,'' by 23-year-old directing prodigy Samira Makhmalbaf of Iran.
The movie _ her third to show in Cannes _ is about a spirited young Afghan who dreams of being her country's first woman president.
Many of its scenes have a haunting beauty, showing the country's ruined palaces and rocky deserts.
``Reconstruction,'' by Denmark's Christoffer Boe, won the Camera d'Or, an award for the best film by a first-time director, while the prize for best short film went to Australia's Glendyn Ivin for ``Cracker Bag.''
for prizes was Clint Eastwood's ``Mystic River,'' a crime drama about three childhood friends brought together years later by a murder.
Appearances by Eastwood and Kidman were among the highlights of the festival, which drew fewer stars than in recent years.
``Elephant'' offered a very different take on school violence than Michael Moore gave in ``Bowling for Columbine,'' a hit at Cannes last year.
Moore's film searched for the roots of violence in America by looking at everything from school shootings to racism to the National Rifle Association.
Van Sant doesn't offer any reasons for why school violence happens;
he just presents it, and leaves it to viewers to think about.
A few details were based on the Columbine massacre, when gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people and then turned their guns on themselves.
Researchers agree that intense physical exercise is not the only way to gain better health.
Studies show that walking several times a week can lower the risk of many diseases.
They include heart disease, stroke, diabetes, bone loss, arthritis and depression.
Walking also can help you lose weight.
Fast walking is good for the heart.
It lowers the blood pressure.
It raises the amount of good cholesterol in the blood.
Researchers say walking can reduce the risk of suffering a heart attack by as much as fifty percent.
Studies have shown that walking for thirty minutes a day can delay and possibly prevent the development of Type Two Diabetes.
It can prevent diabetes among people who are overweight and at risk for the disease.
Walking strengthens the muscles and builds up the bones to which they are attached.
Studies show that women who walked and took calcium decreased their risk of developing osteoporosis or thinning of the bones.
Walking also helps ease the pain of arthritis in areas where bones are joined by strengthening the muscles around the bones.
Walking several times a week is a good way to control your weight and even lose body fat.
Experts say walking is one of the safest ways to exercise.
There is a low risk of injuries.
So it is good for people who are starting an exercise program for the first time and for older people.
A walking program is easy to start.
You should wear loose clothes and good shoes.
Shoes designed for walking are best.
You should stretch the muscles in your arms, legs, and back before and after you walk.
Stretching is an important part of any exercise program.
It helps prevent injury and muscle pain.
How fast should you walk?
Yet, you should be able to talk.
Let your arms move back and forward at your sides while you walk.
There are no rules to starting a walking program.
Or you may walk up hills to strengthen your leg muscles.
Health experts say you can gain the most from a walking program if you walk about five kilometers an hour for thirty minutes a day.
You should do this about five times a week.
PETERSBURG (AP) _ Naval and army cadets marched in tight formation on May 27 across the cobblestones of Palace Square, the epicenter of St.
Thousands of revelers pressed against metal barriers erected around the square, which is bordered on one side by the ornate, sprawling Winter Palace, the one-time seat of czarist power.
Three hundred years is young for a Russian city _ Moscow recently celebrated its 850th anniversary _ but as St.
Petersburg Governor Vladimir Yakovlev pointed out in a speech to the cadets and crowd Tuesday, ``together with Russia it has endured war and revolution.''
It has also endured misery.
``It's a city that has had such a special history in a short period of time,'' said scientist Vladimir Markov as he watched a procession of red-robed Russian Orthodox priests bearing icons outside St.
Petersburg got a major face-lift for the festivities, which are to culminate over the weekend with a Russia-European Union summit and a meeting between Putin, the city's most famous living native son, and U.S.
An ornate gate to the Winter Palace, which now houses the Hermitage Museum, was opened in a ceremony Tuesday, providing access to the building from Palace Square for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution.
Renamed Petrograd in 1914 and Leningrad a decade later, Saint Petersburg got its old name back as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

Cerf also worries about efforts to censor content, like pornography and hate speech.
Such attempts, he says, run up against the First Amendment here and may conflict with values in other cultures.
The meeting's most closely watched moment was the welcoming handshake on June 1 (Sunday) between French President Jacques Chirac and U.S.
President George W. Bush, whose wartime differences led to angry recriminationssmall talk before walking into a luncheon with other presidents and prime ministers.
Chirac, at a news conference later, praised Bush for getting
Congress to pass a $15 billion package to combat AIDS in the developing world.
``Bush took a decision in this area that I would not hesitate to call historic,'' Chirac said.
Largely peaceful demonstrations against the summit deteriorated into battles between riot police and protesters that continued into early Monday.
For more than nine hours, police used rubber pellets, tear gas and water cannons against several thousand militants who rampaged through the Swiss city of Geneva, across the lake from the meeting.
The protesters looted gas stations, pharmacies and other shops, leaving downtown Geneva in a state of chaos.
Even the bulletproof windows of big banks were smashed.
Inside the summit, there was a concerted effort to get beyond Iraq.
White House officials suggested Bush was taking a wait-and-see approach about his relationship with Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, another ardent war foe.
It was a different matter, though, with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who also opposed the U.S.-led drive to depose Saddam Hussein but, in Washington's view, was not confrontational about it.

Nearly 100 meat-eating fish native to China have been found in a Maryland pond where a pet owner dumped two of them in 2000, state officials said amid concern that the fish will become a major threat to native species.
Last week, agency officials caught 99 young northern snakeheads by using an electroshock method that stuns them, causing them to float to the surface of the water.
Two adult fish were released into the Crofton pond two years ago, police said.
State officials discovered the presence of the species in May, when an angler caught a suspicious fish and provided a photo for identification.
Since then, biologists have caught several young fish.
No charges were filed against the owner of the two original fish, whom police would not identify, because the statute of limitations has expired.
"They outgrew the capability of his care, so the individual chose to release them into what he felt was a safe environment," said Capt.
Mark Sanders of the Maryland Natural Resources police.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An upscale neighborhood a block from the presidential residence in Seoul has a new cultural icon:
Opened a week ago, ``Asia Eros Museum'' is a sensation in this deeply Confucian society that has stifled public talk of sex while harboring one of the most prosperous sex industries in Asia.
In the first survey of its kind, government-funded experts estimated that selling sex generated 24 trillion won (US$20 billion)last year, or 4.1 percent of the country's gross domestic product,and employed 330,000 women, thousands of them from Russia and the Philippines.
Some experts say the figures are grossly underestimated.
Alarmed, the government's Ministry of Gender Equality designated fighting the sex industry a top policy goal for this year.
Koreans like to depict themselves as a chaste nation.
An old dictum goes, ``Boys and girls should not sit together in the same room after they turn seven.''
Women used to wear baggy ``hanbok''dresses that hid their physical shape, and were told not to smile at men outside their families.
In February, the National Assembly refused to let a filmmaker shoot a scene of an actress in a miniskirt walking through its main gate.
Film crew members accused the assembly of rejecting their request because the actress was playing a prostitute elected to parliament.
So instead, the crew filmed the actress climb over the assembly's main steel gate while parliamentary security guards tried to stop her.
In real life, however, attitudes about sex are rapidly changing.
Young couples kiss in public _ an act that would have invited disapproving stares, if not a tongue-lashing, from old people a decade ago.
A flood of porn on cyberspace is clicks away in this highly wired country.
``It's time to break the taboo and start a discourse on sex, its pleasure, its distortions and superstitions,'' says Martin Shim, a curator at Asia Eros Museum.
Shim's narrow three-story museum exhibits hundreds of erotic artifacts, from Indian carvings and Tibetan statutes to Chinese folding screens and Korean paintings.
It also illustrates Chinese erotic foot-binding and ancient Korean worship for a penis-shaped rock believed to help women bear boys.
By law, prostitutes and customers can be jailed for up to one year in South Korea, and adulterers twice as much.
But enforcement has been so lax that ``until recently many people didn't even know prostitution was illegal,'' says Song Ae-ri, a sex industry expert at the Ministry of Gender Equality.
Today, the government encourages sex education in grade school and upward.
It is pushing for a new law to increase penalties for running a brothel or arranging prostitution elsewhere from the current maximum five years in prison to a minimum of five years.
Besides 70 red-light districts, thousands of steam-bath saunas,barber shops, night clubs, and ``love'' motels _ whose roofs are often shaped like Disney Land castles _ serve as fronts for prostitution.
``With our rapid economic growth, workers are driven to more competition, and sex has become a way of letting off their stress, rather than an expression of love,'' says Koo Sung-ae, a sex educator.
In May, local media appeared scandalized when a Seoul cafe hosted orgies of men and women who romped naked, wearing only feather masks.
According to police, they selected ``a king'' by lottery and did whatever he bid them do.
The cafe's arrested owner told police he got his business idea from foreign porn Web sites and ``was very proud of bringing a new culture of free sex in Korea,'' said police Sgt.
``I don't see any difference between them and beasts,'' fumed Choi Joon-hwan, 72, a visitor to the sex museum.
For celebrities, violating the public code on sexual conduct carries a steep price.
When video footage of popular actresses and singers having sex with their boyfriends turned up on the Internet in recent years, they were expelled from public life, with TV stations scrambling to cancel their appearances.
One of them apologized for her ``crime''and fled to the United States. Later she even changed her name.
Built centuries ago to keep Mongol marauders and Manchu militias out, the Great Wall of China is again threatened.
This time from the inside.
Vacationers are scattering garbage over its battlements and carving their initials into its ancient bricks.
Villagers cart away pieces to make sheep corrals and developers are leasing land at the wall's foot to build tract homes, a group set up to protect the monument warned.
Hoping to beat back the threat, William Lindesay, an Englishman who in 1987 hiked along 2,470 kilometers (1,530 miles) of the wall, announced the formation of a conservation alliance to protect the most spectacular sections of the wall located around Beijing.
There are 629 kilometers (390 miles) of the wall within the municipal limits of China's capital.
But only a dozen or so kilometers have been restored.
Lindesay wants other parts maintained in their current weathered state and to safeguard spectacular vistas around the wall from what he called "view pollution."
With the backing of Beijing's Cultural Heritage Administration and UNESCO, the U.N. cultural organization, Lindesay's International Friends of the Great Wall plans to hire local farmers as rangers to pick up garbage and make sure bits of wall aren't carried off.
They will place signs along trails leading up to the wall reminding visitors not to smoke, litter or otherwise disturb the environment.
They eventually hope to lobby local governments to ban development that would tarnish the wall's natural setting.
China's best known historical landmark stretches from the seacoast east of Beijing to Gansu province in the western desert.
Its earliest parts were built in the second century B.C. by the emperor Qinshi Huangdi, who connected existing battlements as he conquered his rivals and created the first unitary Chinese state.
More modern sections around Beijing, that most familiar to visitors, date from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and have been restored since the Communist Party took power in 1949.
China boasts thousands of historical monuments from its 5,000-year history and hundreds of major archaeological finds are uncovered each year.
But funds and preservation know-how are stretched thin.
That makes it even more important for non-governmental citizens' groups to participate in preservation, Lindesay said.
WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, acknowledging tirades and tears over her husband's affair with a White House intern, says President Bill Clinton lied to her about the relationship until the weekend before he admitted as much to a grand jury.
Clinton, now a Democratic U.S. senator from New York, vividly describes her pain over the betrayal in ``Living History,'' her new memoir covering her eight years in the White House.
A copy of the book, which goes on sale on June 9 (Monday), was obtained by the Associated Press.
``The most difficult decisions I have made in my life were to stay married to Bill and to run for the Senate from New York,'' she writes.
``For me, the Lewinsky imbroglio seemed like just another vicious scandal manufactured by political opponents.''
More than six months later, with the president preparing to testify before a grand jury, Mrs.
15, 1998, he woke her up, paced at the bedside, and ``told me for the first time that the situation was much more serious than he had previously acknowledged.''
``He now realized he would have to testify that there had been an inappropriate intimacy.
He told me that what happened between them had been brief and sporadic.''
Why did you lie to me
I was furious and getting more so by the second.
I was trying to protect you and Chelsea
Publisher Simon & Schuster, expecting large sales, ordered an extraordinary first printing of 1 million copies.
The first lady-turned-senator was paid a $2.85 million advance toward the $8 million book deal.
Foreign rights have already been sold in 16 countries.
List price for the book is $28.
The publisher billed the book as a complete, candid accounting of her years in the White House.
Clinton said that up until that August morning when her husband confessed, she believed he was being railroaded and had merely been foolish by paying any attention to Lewinsky.
She was incredulous that he would endanger their marriage and family.
``I was dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged that I'd believed him at all.''
She said the president's eyes filled with tears when she told him he would have to confess to their teenage daughter as well.
She ultimately decided she still loved her husband, although ``as a wife, I wanted to wring Bill's neck.''
She describes in bitter terms the months of chill between them, never more painful than when they went to Martha's Vineyard for vacation right after his testimony.
``Buddy, the dog, came along to keep Bill company. He was the only member of our family who was still willing to.''
While on the island, she felt ``nothing but profound sadness, disappointment and unresolved anger.
I could barely speak to Bill, and when I did, it was a tirade.
I walked on the beach.
He slept downstairs.
She said her decision to run for a Senate seat from New York provided a healing bridge for them.
``Bill and I were talking again about matters other than the future of our relationship.
Over time we both began to relax.''
She recounted their last day at the White House, waltzing down a long hallway in her husband's arms.
She concludes that what her husband did was morally wrong but not a betrayal of the public.
On the Whitewater matter that dogged much of their time in the White House, the former first lady acknowledges only ``public relations mistakes in how we handled the growing controversy.''
``Whitewater never seemed real because it wasn't.''
Clinton portrays Whitewater partner Jim McDougall as an embittered man who threatened her several times when she tried to file overdue tax returns for the property.
The payback came, she said, when her husband decided to run for president in 1991 and McDougall planted ``false information about our relationship'' in the press, claiming he had refused favors from Clinton when he was governor.
The final report on the Whitewater investigation questioned the first lady's truthfulness.
Independent Counsel Robert Ray's report concluded that the Clintons' mid-1980s Arkansas land venture benefited from criminal activity and that the president and his wife gave factually inaccurate testimony, but there was not enough evidence to prove the former first lady’s family engaged in wrongdoing.
Clinton's political stock is on the rise, although she insists she will not consider entering the race for president this year.

Throwaway cell phones are set to make their debut on United States convenience store shelves, down the aisle from plastic razors, beef jerky and disposable cameras they seek to emulate as spur-of-the-moment consumer purchases.
Hop-On, a small company based in Garden Grove, California, said this week it had won U.S. regulatory approval to sell its first phones, clearing the way for a nationwide introduction of a no-frills recyclable phone for prepaid mobile calling.
In an interview, Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Michaels said approval of the phones will allow Hop-On shortly to sell its stripped-down mobile phone and 60 minutes of initial service for a $40 flat fee, through an unnamed "major CDMA" carrier.
Hop-On mobile devices are plastic, two-way phones the size of a deck of playing cards.
Users talk and listen to callers via a microphone/earpiece connected by a thin wire.
Customers buy scratch cards in increments of additional talk time of 60, 90 and 120 minutes, according to company officials.
Hop-On, which hopes to sell the phones at major retailers, corner stores and gas stations, said it received a go-ahead from the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission for phones with a low-cost chipset from Philips Electronics based on Qualcomm Inc.
Michaels also hopes to win the FCC's blessing in 45 to 60 days for a second, less-expensive model that would be priced at $29.
This is based on the international GSM mobile standard.
It would be aimed at Europe and eventually the United States.
The company also said it is in talks with as many as 30 major retailers and other companies to distribute the phones, including convenience stores, gas station chains and big retail chains.
Consumer brands, including a major beer company, are looking at licensing Hop-On phones and selling them under their own brand names as promotional items, Michaels said.
The Mangyongbong-92 was to arrive early Monday in the northwestern port of Niigata on its first visit since a North Korean defector told U.S. lawmakers last month that most of the imported parts used in North Korea's missile program were smuggled by passenger ship from Japan.
But North Korean officials called off the trip, saying Japanese authorities and local media were fanning anti-North Korean emotions and creating unsafe conditions for the ship's port call.
``Under these abnormal circumstances we cannot guarantee the ship's normal operations and the safety of the passengers,'' Nam Sung-u, deputy chairman of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, told reporters.
Japan and North Korea have no formal diplomatic relations.
``We are indefinitely suspending the ship's entry due to the abnormal and harsh environment around the Niigata port,'' he said.
Nam said the ferry would not resume operations until Tokyo ``improved'' its actions regarding the ship.
The Mangyongbong-92 was originally scheduled to make 10 trips to Japan through Sept.
Niigata police were planning to mobilize about 1,500 riot police during the ship's planned two-day visit as a precaution against expected protests by rightists and supporters of Japanese who were kidnapped by North Korean spies decades ago.
Customs officials were also planning to tighten their inspections of passengers.
North Korea on Sunday criticized Japan for pressuring the North to suspend the ship's operations.
The statement also warned of ``catastrophic consequences'' if increased surveillance by Japan effectively marked the beginning of economic sanctions against North Korea.
North Korea has repeatedly said it would view sanctions as an act of war.
Japanese officials said their intention to conduct strict searches of the ship and passengers may have convinced North Korea it wasn't a good time to set sail.
``I had a sense that the ship wouldn't be able to return if we had solid inspections in place,'' Niigata Mayor Akira Shinoda told public broadcaster NHK.
The Mangyongbong-92 is the only passenger ship making regular trips between Japan and North Korea.
It carries ethnic Koreans back and forth on excursions and is believed to be an important conduit of cash and goods sent by Japan's Korean community.
Dozens of ethnic Korean students attending pro-North Korean schools in Japan were due to ride the ferry to the North on Tuesday for field trips.
Japan's Korean population of about 200,000 is mostly second- and third-generation residents whose parents and grandparents came to work during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
Niigata is 256 kilometers (159 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
An elaborate matrix of paths scattered throughout the entire solar system can dramatically cut the amount of power needed for spacecraft to explore our celestial neighborhood, NASA announced this week.
Conventional deep space missions use the gravity of celestial bodies one at a time, using nearby planets or moons or the sun to slingshot themselves farther along on their journeys.
But craft using the space freeway, which resembles a complex arrangement of tunnels and passageways, take advantage of previously untapped gravitational relationships between the planets and moons.
"Our theory has refined to the point where we can actually compute these trajectories and we find patterns going around the planets and the sun.
In various regions of our solar system, competing gravitational forces virtually cancel each other out, leaving corridors through which spacecraft can travel with little effort, according to Lo.
"Like threads twisted together to form a rope, the possible flight paths formed tubes in space," JPL said in a statement.
Lo foresees a future in which permanent space outposts could line the superhighway, serving as supply depots for human explorers traveling along the same routes.
Past space wanderers have already tested the space road, including asteroids and comets.
Comet Shoemaker-Levy, for example, collided with Jupiter "when it took an off-ramp toward the giant gas planet," NASA said.
Some scientists theorize that a killer asteroid traveled along the highway when it smacked into Earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
QUTANG, China (AP) _ Even with months of warning, the rising waters of the Yangtze River behind the Three Gorges Dam took thousands of people by surprise.
Engineers had posted signs showing where the water level will be when the reservoir, which started to fill on June 1, reaches its highest point.
But in a sign of the confusion surrounding the world's biggest hydroelectric project, and by sheer force of rural tradition, many planted fields they had been told were doomed.
``They thought their fields were really high and wouldn't be reached by water,'' Ding said.
The Three Gorges Dam is unprecedented in the scale of both its construction and the dislocation imposed on people whose families have lived for centuries along the densely populated Yangtze.
The government is moving about 1.3 million people to higher ground _ some as far away as Shanghai, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) to the east.
Critics say both goals would have been better served by a series of smaller dams.
They warn that the project could worsen pollution by trapping sewage and industrial waste, and that a dam break could lead to catastrophic flooding.
Construction went ahead despite complaints about the 180 billion yuan ($22 billion) cost, forced relocations, environmental damage and flooding of temples and other cultural and archaeological sites.
The government has promised to pay for new homes and farmland for relocated residents.
But some villagers complain that the payments are inadequate, and in a few cases accuse local officials of embezzling money meant for them.
Ding, the farmer in Qutang, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) upstream from the dam, once had a vegetable field of some 3,000 square meters (36,000 square feet). He said that now all but 120 square meters (1,300 square feet) of it is under water.
``The government relocation program wasn't carried out in this village, so we have no money,'' he said.
The reservoir has been rising by two to four meters (six to 12 feet) a day since June 1, when 19 of the dam's 22 sluice gates were shut in a ceremony shown live on national television.
The 190-meter-tall (630-foot-tall) concrete wall is nearly two kilometers (11-2 miles) wide.
Even as the waters crept up Monday, laborers were carrying out last-minute demolition work on lighthouses and other tall buildings due to be engulfed, tearing them down so they won't be a hidden danger to ships.
The Yangtze is one of China's most important transportation arteries, and shipping is to continue through the reservoir, with giant ship locks built to carry freighters and ferries around the immense concrete wall.
Shipping has been banned near the dam since April 10 but is to resume June 16.
China's leaders exalt the dam as a sign of the country's high-tech prowess, but the demolition was being carried out by brute force, with hammers and pickaxes.
Bricks and other salvaged materials were carried away in baskets slung across the backs of donkeys.
A dense blanket of pollution, dubbed the "Asian Brown Cloud," is hovering over South Asia, with scientists warning it could kill millions of people in the region, and pose a global threat.
In the biggest-ever study of the phenomenon, 200 scientists warned that the cloud, estimated to be two miles thick, is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year from respiratory disease.
By slashing the sunlight that reaches the ground by 10 to 15 percent, the choking smog has also altered the region's climate, cooling the ground while heating the atmosphere, scientists said.
While haze hovers over other parts of the world, such as above America and Europe, what surprised scientists was just how far the cloud extended, and how much black carbon was in it, according to A. P. Mitra from India's National Physical Laboratory.
While many scientists once thought that only lighter greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, could travel across the Earth, they now say that aerosol clouds can too.
They discovered not only that the smog cut sunlight, heating the atmosphere, but also that it created acid rain, a serious threat to crops and trees, as well as contaminating oceans and hurting agriculture.
While scientists say it is just early days and they need more scientific data, they do say the regional and global impact of the haze will intensify over the next 30 years, with an estimated five billion people living in Asia.
Discovered in Ethiopia's fossil-rich Afar region, the skulls have clearly modern features _ a prominent forehead, flattened face and reduced brow _ that contrast with older humans' projecting, heavy-browed skulls.
They're close enough to call Homo sapiens,'' said Tim White, a University of California, Berkeley paleontologist who was co-leader of the international team that excavated and analyzed the skulls.
Previously, the earliest fossils of Homo sapiens found in Africa had been dated to about 130,000 to 100,000 years, although they were less complete and sometimes poorly dated, White said.
White and his colleagues assigned the new creatures to a subspecies of Homo sapiens they named Homo sapiens idaltu _ idaltu meaning ``elder'' in the Afar language.
Two other scientists not involved with the research said the skulls are an important find that fill a big gap in the African human fossil record, the period between about 100,000 and 300,000 years ago.
They agreed with< White that the skulls' age and appearance strongly support genetic evidence that modern humans arose in Africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago _ and not at multiple locations in Europe, Africa and Asia as some researchers suggest.
Rick Potts, director of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, said the skulls, while still large and thick-boned, are undeniably modern.
Potts said that while White and his colleagues conclude that the fossil skulls are likely those of ancestral subspecies of Homo sapiens, he believes they represent modern Homo sapiens.
Researchers say they have created a transgenic mouse with muscles like a marathoner, capable of enduring rigorous exercise for extended periods of time.
While so far the research has only been conducted on mice, scientists say they expect the techniques they've developed to treat the mouse muscle will also work on humans.
"PGC-1 appears to be the switch, or a major component of it, that enables your body's muscles to adjust to the demands being put on them," said Spiegelman.
"Understanding how this system works could make it possible to develop a drug to manipulate this system."
Muscle is made up of a combination of different types of fibers.
Sprinters or weightlifters, on the other hand, have muscle rich in fast-twitch, Type II fibers.
These muscles are bulkier and stronger but tire quickly.
To create the endurance mouse, Spiegelman's group bioengineered PGC-1 into mouse muscle tissue.
But they were surprised to find that PGC-1 appeared to be converting Type II fast-twitch fibers into Type I slow-twitch fibers.
The muscle itself actually changed color, taking on a reddish hue characteristic of oxygen-rich tissue.
Further, in an endurance test at a Texas laboratory, the bioengineered muscle turned out to contract efficiently two and a half times longer than regular muscle.
The area is sparsely populated.
Students sleep in the same room and eat in a communal dining hall.
One student jokingly compared life to that of ``pigs in a pig pen.''
The all-boy Hansamm institute is one of dozens of cram schoolsproliferating in areas around Seoul where the pupils study hour after hour, preparing to clear a hurdle that will determine their future _ college entrance exams.
``Here life is so removed from the lure of cities that the boys have no choice but to study _ there is nothing else to do,'' says Hwang Min-ho, an instructor who carries a short, black baton as a symbol of discipline.
The regimen is called either ``hapsuk'' or ``kisuk.''
Basically it means ``sleeping and eating together'' in Korean, and the system reflects a belief that doing things together improves performance.
``I had difficulty adjusting at first, but I don't complain because I came here to avoid society and save time for studying.''
For South Koreans, group activity comes naturally.
Men serve a mandatory 26-month military service during which dozens of soldiers sleep on the same floor.
Office workers join ``hoe-shik,'' or group dinners, and like to sing and dance together in karaoke bars.
Parents send youngsters to special boot camps run by South Korean marines to learn teamwork and patience.
South Korea's school system is long credited with mass-producing dedicated workers, a key to the country's high-tempo economic success.
But it also created pressure-cooker conditions that emphasize rote learning for standardized exams.
In South Korea, which college one attends has far-reaching implications.
But as a saying here goes, ``when it comes to children's education, Korean parents don't care whether they jump in water or fire.''
A mother working as a department store clerk gives up almost all of her monthly wage to send her son to Hansamm.
Hansamm is miles from the nearest town.
During summer vacation, high-school seniors study at Hansamm.
But its 70 full-time residents are ``jaesoo sang,'' or ``study-again students,'' who didn't get into the university of their choice and are cramming for the following year's test.
Graduates of cram schools remember friends jumping the walls at night, lured by neon signs in the distance, and corporal punishment for disruptive students _ a common practice in many South Korean schools.
Sirens wail or loud music blares at 6:30 a.m. to wake the students.
After a roll call and exercise, classes begin at 8 a.m.
Another roll call comes at midnight, when students must go to bed _ unless they are studying, which they can do for another hour or two.
``But that's the very reason I came here.''
Hansamm allows students a two-night leave every three weeks.
When they return, officials check bags for items deemed distracting:
The institute plans to take students bird watching, rafting in a nearby river and on a tour to an ``invasion tunnel'' North Korea dug under the DMZ in the 1970s.
The boys seek their own diversion.
``We recently hired a new, young female nurse,'' said Hansamm's headmaster, Yoon Chong-sok.
It was dented by overseas summer trips and a rise in imports, the central bank said on Wednesday.
The central bank said the current account might turn to a deficit in August.
But the bank maintained its 2002 forecast of a $5 billion current account surplus.
The July figure was down from a surplus of $442.2 million the same time last year.
The travel deficit grew to a record $409.0 million in July as more South Koreans went abroad over the summer, the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
Hefty spending on overseas trips and study could trigger a current account deficit in 2003, Deputy Finance Minister for International Affairs Kim Yong-duk said on Tuesday.
Earlier this month, the governor of the central bank Park Seung said the current account surplus in 2002 would be at least $4 billion, lower than the bank's target of $5 billion or equivalent to about one percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
In the first seven months of the year, the current account surplus stood at $3.55 billion, versus $6.97 billion a year earlier, the Bank of Korea said.
Current account, the broadest measure of trade with other countries, includes all goods and services as well as capital transactions and non-business transfers such as donations and aid.
LONDON (AP) _ Days before the new Harry Potter novel was to go on sale around the world, thousands of copies of the book were stolen in Britain, prompting police on June 17 (Tuesday) to threaten the arrest of anyone caught selling them on the black market.
Rowling's, 38, series about a boy wizard, ``Order of the Phoenix,'' have been guarded with great secrecy by publisher Bloomsbury.
Merseyside police, who are investigating the theft, issued a statement warning people that if they ``handle the book before Saturday in anything other than a legitimate manner, they could face criminal charges.''
Bloomsbury also used the robbery to remind the public that a legal injunction prevents any publication of the contents or summary of the book before it goes on sale this weekend and also requires the return of any missing books to the publisher.
(2130 GMT) Sunday, along with the truck trailer they were packed in _ ready for distribution around Britain ahead of the launch early Saturday morning _ from an industrial park in the town of Newtown-le-Willows, northern England.
The trailer was found by police on Monday about 18 miles (29 kilometers) away in Salford, Greater Manchester _ minus its valuable load.
Police said initial investigations had found that a man driving the front cab of a similar-style trailer, which also was stolen, had falsely presented himself to security as the legitimate driver.
``The van is being forensically examined, and we are appealing for witnesses,'' said Caroline Foran, a spokeswoman for Merseyside police.
She declined to say how many police officers were involved in the investigation, on the ground that it could jeopardize the inquiry.
The launch of the book is so hotly anticipated that Internet retailer Amazon.com said it has received more than 1 million advance orders for the book.
Rowling's four previous Potter novels have sold more than 190 million copies in 55 languages and 200 countries.
Earlier this month, a printing plant worker was sentenced to 180 hours community service for stealing pages from the forthcomingnovel he found in a parking lot as he was leaving work.
Donald Parfitt, 44, was arrested after The Sun newspaper told police it received a call from ``a shifty-sounding man'' offering three chapters of the book for 25,000 pounds (US$40,000).
Magistrates in Lowestoft, eastern England, said they considered sending Parfitt to jail because of the ``serious breach of trust and the high potential value'' of the stolen work.
The Sun also reported last month that two unbound, uncut copies of the novel were found in a field near the printer's offices.
A new study has found that mobile phone radiation is unlikely to increase the risk of cancer, challenging earlier research which suggested a possible link.
Researchers at Australia's Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science exposed 1,600 mice to varying degrees of mobile phone radiation over a two year period but found no increase in the cancer rate as a result.
An earlier study of mice exposed to mobile phone radiation conducted by the institute in the mid-1990s found a two-fold increase in lymphoma in genetically modified mice.
The new study was designed to repeat the earlier work, with more mice and stricter control over how they were exposed to the radiation.
The mice were split into two groups, with one group comprising mice which had been genetically modified to have a tendency to develop cancerous tumors.
A parallel study is underway by an Italian research group funded by the European Commission.
Findings from that research is expected in about 12 months.
For years, the North has let small-scale trading posts, known as ``farmers' markets,'' operate independently of the state-run distribution system.
``People with access to land, farming families, are now allowed to have kitchen gardens and thus more small markets have sprung up,'' said Kathi Zellweger, the director of aid to North Korea for the charity Caritas.
Farmers and other producers have even begun to set up roadside stalls, and bartering in public is common, she said.
The markets are thriving as North Korea intensifies a war of words with the United States over the reclusive regime's nuclear programs.
Washington and its allies have been turning up the heat on Pyongyang, using a combination of diplomacy and isolation to dissuade the North from continuing its nuclear programs and trade in narcotics, counterfeit money and missile parts.
On June 18 (Wednesday), the North acknowledged publicly for the first time that it has a nuclear weapons program.
With North Korea's main sources of hard currency in danger of running dry and its isolation growing, experts say the regime needs the farmers' markets more than ever to keep goods and money circulating.
Years of mismanagement and an ``army-first'' policy have left the economy in a shambles.
In the 1990s, famine struck, killing hundreds of thousands.
The North now relies heavily on outside food aid to feed its 22 million people.
To resuscitate the economy, North Korea implemented reforms last July.
It scaled back subsidies, increased wages and allowed prices to adjust to their real value, measures some observers have compared to a policy China pursued in the late 1970s when it gradually opened
But a year later, inflation is estimated at about 300 percent,the currency has plunged and goods are scarcer than ever.
Although the economy grew 1.2 percent in 2002 for the fourth-straight year of growth, output from key mining, manufacturing and power industries is declining, South Korea's central Bank of Korea says.
There are positive signs.
Since it began delivering aid to the North in 1996, the United Nations' World Food Program has gradually gained access to areas previously off-limits.
``That's a great leap forward,'' said Gerald Bourke, a spokesman for the WFP's aid project in North Korea which has grown to five local offices and a staff of 40.
North Korea's record with capitalism is abysmal.
In the mid-1980s, the North created a free economic zone close to the northeastern border with Russia that foreign investors avoided because it lacked infrastructure.
Only a few empty hotels now stand there.
Despite their surge, the farmers' markets are still a minuscule part of the North's economy.
Fewer than 7 million, or about one-third of the population, living in agricultural areas can buy at the markets.
The Bank of Korea estimates that private sector trade
Marcus Noland, an economist at the New York-based Institute for International Economics, said Pyongyang's anti-capitalist track record suggests it may actually be trying to tighten controls, not loosen them.
Previously, farmers sold their goods to the markets because of higher prices there than in the state distribution centers.
By raising official prices, the government may want farmers to channel crops back through the public system, Noland told the U.S. Senate in testimony earlier this month.
But experts say North Korea's fate may be beyond its control.
Whatever onomatopoeia you want to use, the result was the same:
Big names like Pets.com, Living.com, Furniture.com and many others simply folded.
Most of the 2000 debacle had little to do with the concept of selling things over the Internet.
It is clear that using the Web to sell stuff to people
And though it's still tiny, e-commerce is growing and hasn't even reached the beginning of its potential.
The "bubble" was not an e-commerce phenomenon.
It was a Wall Street phenomenon.
The stock market's wild swings are like the mood fluctuations of a child going to the amusement park.
The night before, the child is so excited he or she can barely sleep, talking about every ride and all the food.
But by the time you're in the car on your way, the child gets cranky and starts screaming "Are we there yet?"
When you finally arrive, you're exhausted
But Wall Street and the venture capitalists played a dangerous game with the companies by breaking an unspoken promise.
By building up the companies based on their original business models, the markets were saying, "you're doing the right thing;
do it well and we'll give you enough money to climb the mountain."
Nothing changed except that the investors changed their mind.
The plans they had bought into no longer were good enough, and any company that couldn't change was left to die.
Part of it is just business evolution.
The new plans are largely better plans.
E-commerce may have come of age, but it's a long way from adulthood.
It's left the idealistic childhood.
But it still has all those awkward, gawky, surly teenage years ahead of it.
WASHINGTON (AFP) _ U.S. lawmakers took aim at``spam'' messages on June 19 (Thursday), as two separate bills worked their way through the U.S.
Utah Senator Orrin Hatch co-sponsored one bill introduced Thursday, the Criminal Spam Act of 2003, which targets people who hijack computer systems or use other fraudulent means to send unsolicited commercial e-mail.
``The abusive practices of fraudulent spammers threaten to choke the lifeblood of the electronic age,'' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said in a statement.
Their bill would make it a crime to hijack the identities of other computer uses to send bulk commercial e-mail or to conceal key information about the e-mail's source.
Violators could face up to five years in prison.
A separate anti-spam bill, authored by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, was unanimously approved Thursday by the Commerce Committee.
Wyden said in a statement that his bill aimed to ``slow the flow of spam,'' but another anti-spam crusader in the U.S. legislature, said the bill, while a good start, didn't go far enough.
Schumer, a New York Democrat, earlier this year introduced his own bill that would impose heavy fines for spamming, mandate jail term for repeat offenders, and create a ``Do-Not-Spam'' list of e-mail addresses.

According to industry analysts, the automotive computer technology market should grow from about $1 billion in 2000 to $8 billion by 2005.
Already, many companies are developing devices to provide cars with entertainment, Internet capability, satellite navigation, satellite radio, and futuristic safety features so that they look like something straight out of a James Bond movie.
The MP3 jukebox, available in March 2001 for select Fords, is an add-on accessory to cars' existing sound systems.
The jukebox features software that lets users load hundreds of hours of music stored on MP3 files in their computers onto a small cartridge that then goes into the car.
also plans to demonstrate various other new safety, security and entertainment technologies, not yet available on the market, in a souped-up vehicle at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
1 automotive products supplier, is demonstrating satellite radio at the Consumer Electronic Show.
Slated to be available in 2001, satellite radio is a revolutionary new band of radio that will deliver non-stop, digital-quality music and other programming directly via satellite to vehicles and residences.
Delphi won a multiyear purchase contract in November 1999 to build satellite-capable audio systems for General Motors Corp.
Dan Garretson, an analyst with Forrester Research, said he sees the automotive technology sector growing rapidly, with sales of devices like MP3 players, DVD players and satellite radios hitting a cumulative 28 million units by 2005.
(AFP) _ McDonald's said it has instructed its meat suppliers to phase out the use of growth-promoting antibioticsanimal husbandry on June 19 (Thursday) in the service of the wider public health battle on antibiotic resistance in humans.
``We take seriously our obligation to understand the emerging science of antibiotic resistance, and to work with our suppliers to foster real, tangible changes in our own supply community, and hopefully beyond,'' said Frank Muschetto, McDonald's vice president of global supply chain management, in a statement.
The father of all fast-food chains buys 2.5 million pounds of meat a year globally and with that type of purchasing power, McDonald's can ``help to reverse the trend of antibiotics overuse in animal agriculture,'' said Gwen Ruta, program director for Environmental Defense.
The chain consulted widely with scientists and environmental pressure groups, including Environmental Defense, in drawing up its new policy-making document.
It also drew on the experience of its European division that began phasing out the antibiotics during 2000.
By the end of 2001, all of the chain's European-based poultry suppliers had eliminated growth-promoting antibiotics for use in chicken feed.
Suppliers will still be able to use antibiotics for therapeutic purposes and disease prevention, according to Longest.
Scientists are concerned that the widespread use of these antibiotics in animals, alongside the well documented over prescription of drugs by doctors, is contributing to rising human resistance to the drugs.
In particular, bacteria that live in the gastrointestinal systems of animals and develop an immunity to the drugs can sicken humans if they make it into the food chain in one form or another.
``There are salmonella strains resistant to six different classes of antibiotics,'' noted Becky Goldburg, senior scientist at New-York based Environmental Defense.
Salmonella, one of the best-known sources of food poisoning, can be fatal.
A revolutionary new way of healing backs and bones could someday benefit millions.
The experimental approach, which utilizes a genetically engineered protein to help the body grow new bone exactly where it is needed, has proven 100 percent effective in early tests in patients with slipped vertebrae and fractures, researchers say.
A very common back problem has been making 68-year-old Vincent Porretti's job painfully impossible.
He's the theater manager at an Atlantic City casino.
Porretti has a disorder afflicting 6 percent of people over 65 to some degree.
One of his vertebrae, or backbones, has slipped against another, causing severe pain.
Porretti needed surgery to fuse four vertebrae together.
Usually, doctors take a bone graft from the patient's hip or put in metal rods to create the fusion.
But both methods have serious side effects in 20 percent of cases.
Alexander Vaccaro of the Rothman Institute at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, is the first to try a revolutionary approach.
He puts in a putty that actually prompts the body to grow new bone exactly where the doctor wants it.
still experimental but expected to win approval from the U.S.
the doctor simply adds water to a mix of two powders, and molds it like clay.
a genetically engineered version of a natural body chemical that plays a major role in bone growth.
Doctors are testing the putty not just on backs but also on fractures of legs, arms and other bones.
Many say this is just the first step in a new technology that will transform orthopedic medicine.
"I think we will find that bones will heal much better," says Dr.
Thomas Einhorn, chief of orthopedic surgery at Boston University Medical Center.
"And we will even be in a position where we may be able to regenerate entire segments of the skeleton, and restore patients who have really severe injuries."
So far, 19 patients have had the spinal surgery with OP1 putty with, Vaccaro says, a 100 percent success rate.
Porretti says he was pain-free immediately after surgery, despite having to wear a brace for a few weeks.
derives from the ancient practice of using tattoos to brand thieves and slaves.
But when police launched their nationwide search early this month for men with tattoos, they were looking for a new breed of criminals _ young men who have their bodies tattooed to evade the country's mandatory military service, crucial to its defense against communist North Korea.
Some 170 have been arrested on charges of ``willfully tampering with their bodies to avoid military duty'' _ a crime punishable by up to three years in prison.
National media showed the disgraced youths, handcuffed, heads bowed, and tops undressed to reveal full-backside tattoos of dragons, scaled fishes, birds and roses.
Although there is no law against tattoos, South Koreans have considered them symbols of disgrace, often associated with gangsters.
The nation's conscription law rules men with large tattoos unfit for the military because they cause ``abomination among fellow soldiers.''
Most see military service as a sacred duty of manhood.
By law, those seeking top government jobs or running for parliament must reveal not only their own service records but those of their children.
But some youngsters complain that they have to interrupt careers and schooling.
Disenchantment grew after repeated scandals showed that many of the country's rich and powerful pay bribes or help their sons get U.S. citizenship to keep them out of the military.
Fat men eat more and skinny ones fast to win exemption.
Some have doctored X-ray photographs or had surgery to damage ligaments or knee cartilage.
``There is a need to warn those who would do anything to avoid military service,'' Judge Kim Sung-keun said early this month as he sentenced a 24-year-old father with two children to eight months in prison for using tattoos to avoid conscription.
Authorities base their arrests, in some cases, on suspects’ history of military physical exams.
If a young man goes through one exam without overly large tattoos, but comes back for another round with an outsized dragon and secures an exemption, he would be under suspicion.
Investigators also have interviewed tattoo artists about the motives of their customers.
In the early 1980s, the country's military junta launched a crackdown on political dissidents and organized crime under its ``campaign for social purification.''
Historians say some ancient Korean fishermen had full-body tattoos, believing that would protect them from sea beasts when shipwrecked.
Slaves once carried tattoos on their forearms showing who owned them.
Confucianism, the centuries-old primer on social behavior, urged Koreans to ``preserve the body, hair and skin inherited from ancestors.''
Today, however, plastic surgery, hair dyeing and piercing are booming industries.
When soccer star and local sex symbol Ahn Jung-hwan scored his winning goal against Japan earlier this month, he threw off his shirt and flashed tattoos on both shoulders.
``In the following days, I had 10 times more people visiting my Web site,'' said Kang Ho, a Seoul tattooist who finds South Korea's regulations on tattoos ``out of date'' and ``ridiculous.''
Martin Luther King first made his way into my consciousness around 1963, his was not a flattering image.
In my mind, King was "lame."
He was "square," in a Sidney Poitier-kind-of-way, "profiling" his way through the pain of his people, always mindful of where the camera was.
As long as the weather was fair, he would breeze into a town and lead thousands in a demonstration.
Hundreds would be arrested, including King.
He would get bailed out that night and head to the next town with his "snake oil" brand of salvation.
But by 1968 the Black Power movement, with which I then identified, had closed ranks around our brothers and sisters in the non-violent civil rights movement.
There was a revolution going on, and everyone who was black was being swept up into it, like it or not.
Led by King, even mainstream civil rights activists were risking more.
He spoke against the Vietnam War.
His life was a testament to his message:
"The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice."
Just look at how it bent a previously unwilling President Ronald Reagan to sign the Martin Luther King holiday law, only 15 years after King's assassination.
Both the man and his mission grew out of our needs.
"If King didn't exist we would have invented him."
Our King emerged at a time when black "royalty" was in demand.
This is the American King I reflect on in 2001:
Martin Luther King Jr., the aristocrat who ennobled his own people and even the nation, which tried to strip that royalty from him through constant undeserved abuse and eventual murder.
In the end, this nation elevated him to a pedestal no other American has ever occupied.
On any given day, about 800,000 items pack the four-story warehouse, with 5,000 new ones trucked in every morning for an annual haul of 220,000 articles of clothing, 30,000 mobile phones, 18,000 eyeglasses and 17,000 wallets.

As Tokyo celebrates its 400th anniversary as Japan's capital this summer, there is perhaps no better testimony to the city's rapid rise from tiny 17th century fishing village to megalopolis of 12 million people than its downtown lost-and-found.
Recently, someone turned in a martial arts suit for traditional Japanese fencing _ freshly used and still reeking of sweat.
``We had to wash it out because it smelled so bad,'' Hasuda said, gesturing to the bulky blue garments strung between the steel racks to dry.
Last year, about 1.62 million articles coursed through the center, making it possibly the world's single biggest lost-and-found.
About 250 hopefuls visit each day to see if their lost keys, briefcases and billfolds are in the labyrinth of gray steel cabinets.
A 2.2-ton freight elevator shuttles the smorgasbord of goods between floors, while workers on cherry-pickers snag items from the top shelves.
Jewelry, computers and other valuables are locked away in a vault.
Typical of a country obsessed with order and detail, every item is scrupulously labeled with time and place of recovery, then computer archived _ no matter how seemingly trivial.
One Good Samaritan turned in a phone card worth only 42 cents.
It's now tagged and waiting in a drawer cluttered with half-used train passes.
Back in 1980, a single cash stash of 100 million yen ($850,000) went unclaimed, and its finder became keeper, Hasuda said.
After that, the items can be claimed by the finder, or else revert to the city.
Items at the lost-and-found department of New York's Grand Central Terminal, by contrast, are kept for just 90 days, though items worth more than 600,000 yen (US$5,000) must be kept for three years.
It has an average daily inventory of 4,000 goods and donates unclaimed possessions to charity.
Tokyo keeps the cash and sells the unclaimed goods to junk dealers, adding 295 million yen (US$2.5 million) to the city coffers every year.
Both Tokyo and Grand Central claim a respectable 60 percent or so of lost items get back to their owners.
Hasuda's staff of 30 police officers tries to contact owners of other items whenever their identities can be gleaned from turned-in documents, letters, bills or business cards.
Tetsuro Takahashi was one of them.
The center called his cell phone operator when his red clamshell mobile turned up there two weeks ago.
``I'm pretty lucky,'' the 30-year-old said after reclaiming the phone on a sunny afternoon.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country.
With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.
As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation.
And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.
I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.
We have a place, all of us, in a long story
a story we continue, but whose end we will not see.
It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.
It is the American story
a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.
Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.
And though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.
Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea.
Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.
Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along.
And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.
While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country.
The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.
And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.
We do not accept this, and we will not allow it.
Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation.
And this is my solemn pledge:
I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.
I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image.
And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.
America has never been united by blood or birth or soil.
We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens.
Every child must be taught these principles.
Every citizen must uphold them.
And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.
Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.
America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility.
But the stakes for America are never small.
If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.
If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism.
If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.
We must live up to the calling we share.
It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.
And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.
America, at its best, is also courageous.
Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good.
Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.
We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.
We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent.
And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.
We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.
The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake:
America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.
We will defend our allies and our interests.
We will show purpose without arrogance.
We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.
And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.
HONG KONG (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of angry and worried Hong Kong residents marched peacefully on July 1 (Tuesday) to protest an anti-subversion law in the territory's biggest rally since China used troops to crush a mainland student democracy movement in 1989.
Hong Kong people fear the law will undermine local freedoms of speech, press and assembly.
Their massive protest vastly overshadowed official ceremonies earlier Tuesday marking the sixth anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997.
``This will push Hong Kong toward an era of tyranny,'' said W.C.
Mak, a 74-year-old retired nurse who hasn't demonstrated against anything since she joined the 1 million people who flooded the streets in shock and rage after the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
An organizer of Tuesday's protest, Richard Tsoi, said more than 500,000 people had turned out.
Police said 350,000 people were on the streets during the peak of the demonstration, and said the total would have been higher.
They acknowledged it was the biggest protest here since the June 4, 1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square shocked Hong Kong.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chen-hwa issued a statement saying he was ``concerned'' so many people had protested.
Tung reiterated assurances his government will ``continue to take active steps to maintain and safeguard rights and freedoms.''
Critics are worried about mainland-style suppression of dissent in Hong Kong, although the government insists that is not a concern and that constitutionally protected liberties will not be harmed.
The protesters, clad in black and waving signs, formed a long line of humanity as many as two dozen deep.
The demonstration extended across a wide stretch of Hong Kong island and took six and a half hours before everybody could file past government headquarters.
To commemorate the 1997 return of Chinese sovereignty, a uniformed band played patriotic music earlier Tuesday and helicopters dragged the Chinese and Hong Kong flags through the sky as government leaders, including Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, stood at silent attention.
Activists outside torched the flag of the Chinese Communist Party, demanding an end to its monopoly on power in the mainland and scuffling with police.
Wen was later asked about the anti-subversion bill and told journalists it ``absolutely will not affect the different rights and freedoms that Hong Kong people _ including reporters _ enjoy under the law.''
Wen left Hong Kong before the march.
Vincent Lui, a 35-year-old engineer who said he had never protested before, turned out with his wife and two small children, holding a black flag that said:
When Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997, an arrangement dubbed ``one country, two systems'' guaranteed the territory could maintain its liberties.
But its mini-constitution also required that it pass an anti-subversion law.
``It's like a knife on top of our heads,'' said Lo Chi-yin, who like many here expressed worries about his children's future.
Smaller numbers of people voiced support for the law.
Hong Kong fishermen sailed dozens of boats around the harbor, flying the Chinese flag high to show their patriotism.

perhaps even the key to solving some current environmental ills.
And the field is advancing rapidly.
The National Science Foundation has been cutting its timetable for the release of nanotech-fueled products from five or 10 years to two or three years, said Mihail Roco, NSF's senior adviser on nanotechnology.
The current state of nanotechnology mirrors the level of development in the field of polymers and plastics in the 1930s, when it was in its infancy, said Kevin Ausman, director of the Rice University Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology.
The plastics industry quickly expanded, of course, providing the materials for a large portion of manufactured goods.
NSF's National Nanotechnology Initiative, which leads the U.S. government's efforts in the field, has been researching nanotechnology's potential environmental benefits.
Roco and other proponents say that, for instance, filter systems for drinking or waste water, natural gas pipelines and smokestacks can be designed at the molecular level, to remove even the most minuscule of impurities.
For water, that means cleaner drinking.
For gas, finer filtration means cleaner burning, with fewer smog-creating impurities.
And industrial plants may be able to use more sensitive emission "scrubbers" that screen even nano-sized flecks of soot from waste gases.
Nanoparticles are also being examined for use as sensors to monitor air or drinking water for the presence of toxins.
Pollution-absorbing nanoparticles that can be used to clean up tainted water or soil is another concept under study, Roco said.

There is less waste in the production process and in the trash, when nano-devices are discarded at the end of their lives, Roco said.
KAESONG, North Korea (AP) _ A steel propaganda tower stood forlorn, a symbol of North Korean anachronism.
Paint peeling off, it carried a slogan that bears little connection with the reality of the impoverished country:
``Let's revamp our lives with our own strength!''
A kilometer (half a mile) away, communist authorities welcomed a swarm of capitalist investors from South Korea.
Young North Korean women, their tan rugged faces softened by cheap cosmetics, smiled and danced with regimented grace.
A sound system blared a high-pitched song:
``Yes, I am glad to see you too,'' an old South Korean entrepreneur said to a shy North Korean woman handing him a flower.
The groundbreaking ceremony on June 30 (Monday) for a joint industrial park near the inter-Korean border revealed a country at odds with itself, a totalitarian regime striving to rebuild its shattered economy with outside help while keeping up its harsh tone on its suspected nuclear weapons program.
Contradictions abounded in Kaesong, an ancient city just north of the border.
Red-and-white slogans called for loyalty to leader Kim Jong-il, ``the sun of the 21st century,'' and urged people to ``defend our way of living with our lives.''
Muscled soldiers and workers in roadside murals brandished bayonets to ``beat the U.S. imperialists, our sworn enemy!''
At each tourist stop, however, Kaesong people were eager to make a few American dollars.
They displayed ginseng, porcelain, traditional paintings, and even ``adder liquor'' _ a bottle of fiery whiskey with a coiled, discolored snake in it.
When a clerk lifted a bottle by its neck, the cap came loose.
She calmly replaced it and put the bottle back on display.
Kaesong was once Korea's capital and commercial hub.
Its traders were the first Koreans to practice bookkeeping.
Today, communist clerks armed with electronic calculators handled U.S. dollars, euros and even South Korean won as deftly as a department store clerk in Seoul.
Kaesong, a shade below the 38th Parallel, was part of South Korea before the 1950-53 Korean War.
When a new border was drawn at the end of the war, it became part of North Korea.
Now the city hopes to attract South Korean investors and tourists _ a dream vulnerable to nuclear tensions on the divided peninsula.
``In this old Korean center of trade, we hope to open a new chapter of prosperity together with South Korea,'' said Choe Hyun-gu, a North Korean trade official.
Communist authorities have turned an ancient Confucian temple, Songkyunkwan, into a museum and planned to open its oldest neighborhoods to Southern tourists.
A middle-aged female guide said she once escorted leader Kim Jong-il's late father, president Kim Il-sung, through the museum, and it remained her ``happiest memory.''
From a hill, a shining bronze statue of the senior Kim, the North's demigod, stood overlooking streets lined with old zelkova and ginkgo trees.
Although Kaesong is a major provincial city, it had few cars _ a cultural shock for day-trippers from traffic-congested Seoul.
Shops kept their doors closed and few people were seen inside.
Impoverished yet heavily militarized, the country describes every aspect of daily life as a ``heroic struggle.''
A smaller sign said it really was a pepper-paste factory.
All people walked, men in their dark brown Mao-style khaki attire and women in baggy pants and nylon shirts with flower decorations.
School children wore red scarves and walked as if marching.
Without electricity, men fought the summer heat by keeping windows open and staying topless.
Many waved at the air-conditioned South Korean tourist buses.
A small girl in rags digging in a roadside ditch stood awe-struck by the buses coming her way.
Closer to the border, North Korea built a propaganda village, Kijong-dong, with clean apartment buildings.
But a mile behind it, low-slung, identical huts of cinderblocks and gray tiles clustered on hills shorn of trees.
Sunken roofs were patched with plastic sheets.
New Hyundai earth-movers, lent by the South, were doing all the work to build a cross-border road that will eventually link Seoul and Kaesong.
The fact that North Korea is allowing South Koreans to see the embarrassing foibles of its system shows its eagerness for economic help.
Newly built front-line billboards near concrete tank traps showed a cherubic boy and girl and exhorted:
At the end of the tour day, South Koreans found there was more than one price system in North Korea.
One reporter bought a bottle of red ginseng whiskey for eight euros and hours later he found another shop selling it for just five euros.
America, at its best, is compassionate.
In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise.
And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.
And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.
Where there is suffering, there is duty.
Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities.
And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.
Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools.
Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.
And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.
Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do.
And I can pledge our nation to a goal:
When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.
America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.
Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience.
And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment.
We find the fullness of life not only in options, but in commitments.
And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.
Sometimes in life we are called to do great things.
But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love.
The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.
I will live and lead by these principles:
to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.
In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.
What you do is as important as anything government does.
I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort;
to defend needed reforms against easy attacks;
to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor.
I ask you to be citizens:
citizens, not spectators;
responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.
When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it.
When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.
After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson:
"We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong.
Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?"
Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration.
The years and changes' accumulated.
But the themes of this day he would know:
our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.
We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose.
Yet his purpose is achieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.
This work continues.
And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.
and its top shareholder LG Group over a bailout offer from a U.S. consortium.
Information and Communication Minister Chin Dae-je urged LG, the country's second largest conglomerate, and Hanaro to settle the dispute on their own.
Hanaro's union supports the plan to borrow 600 million dollars from the consortium and the sale to it of new shares worth 450 million dollars, arguing that LG will not be able to resolve the company's debt problems.
Hanaro needs to repay a 450 billion won debt in the second half.
``Ten board members including an LG representative are engaged in lengthy debate on AIG's offer,'' Hanaro spokesman Kim Song-Bae told AFP.
``The board is trying to make a decision today, although we cannot say when the results will come,'' he added.
LG, which holds a 13 percent stake in Hanaro, has opposed the proposed share sale which would allow the US consortium to acquire a 40 percent stake in the broadband service provider.
Instead, the conglomerate proposed that Hanaro make a 500 billion won (420 million dollars) rights issue, which it would then take up.
LG insists the consortium's offer of 3,000 won per share is below the fair market price.
In response, the consortium has raised its bid to 3,100 won, Hanaro said, adding that if the offer was accepted, AIG would become the largest shareholder in the company.
AIG chairman Hank Greenberg, on a visit to Seoul last week, said:
``We believe that the consortium's bid is fair and would benefit investors and the shareholders and the country in the long run.''
The government is seeking the slow but steady consolidation of South Korea's telecom industry which has become becalmed due to overlapping investments and competition.
``Our foremost policy goal is to create a fair and competitive market system that effectively works ... whether it's run by two or three groups does not matter,'' Chin said.
The Hanaro/LG dispute highlights efforts by South Korean telecom firms to get through a period of slow growth, stricter government regulations on subsidies for mobile phone handsets and weak consumption caused by an economic downturn.
Hanaro's rich subscriber base would help LG take on market leader KT Corp.
LG has also indicated it could acquire Thrunet Co, a troubled minor Internet service provider.
In Iran this week, the Supreme Court upheld a death sentence by stoning for a woman convicted of murdering her husband.
However, a quirk of Islamic law says she can go free if she manages to escape while the stoning is taking place.
Last week in Saudi Arabia, three people, including a mother and her daughter were beheaded for murder.
Decapitation for capital crimes such as murder and adultery in Saudi Arabia are routine.
Public amputations of fingers, hands and sometimes feet are performed in Iran, the Saudi kingdom and by the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan.
Men also face harsh punishment under Sharia law in countries such as Saudia Arabia and Iran, but sentences delivered by the courts tend to be biased against women.
The plaintiff in the case was a male, who sued Kuwait's Interior Ministry for refusing to write the names of five women, including his own wife, into the parliamentary electoral rolls last year.
The same court, the highest in Kuwait, has thrown out four similar pleas filed by female activists who claimed Kuwait's electoral law barring female voting was discriminatory and unconstitutional.
Kuwait's supreme ruler, or emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, issued a decree in May 1999 granting women full political rights and his Cabinet approved the decree.
Kuwait is the only Gulf State monarchy with a freely elected parliament.
After the last elections in July 1999, women raised the intensity of the campaign for voting rights.
Khawthar al-Jouan, a female lawyer who helped fight the latest case in court, told reporters in Kuwait:
"We will continue the way we have started.
We will not be discouraged."
The comments by Chinese President Hu Jintao and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun came at the start of a visit aimed at strengthening ties between the two countries and addressing the North's nuclear ambitions.
``In order to fully and satisfactorily resolve the North Korean nuclear issue ... we must open up channels between all concerned parties as soon as possible,'' Roh said at a news conference following closed-door meetings.
``And in order to reach a consensus, all sides need to make relentless efforts.''
Hu said both countries agreed on the importance of maintaining ``peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and ... to peacefully resolve the situation on the Korean Peninsula.''
``We want to avoid the situation getting out of hand, so we need to deepen our efforts to make a breakthrough,'' Hu said.
``At the same time we think we must earnestly consider the security concerns of North Korea,'' Hu said.
China is reclusive North Korea's leading ally and has said it wants Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons _ a stand Hu repeated in his comments.
In April, it hosted the first formal talks between Washington and Pyongyang since the nuclear dispute started in October.
Roh called for Beijing to play a ``constructive role'' in resolving the dispute over the North's nuclear program.
Roh also was to meet Premier Wen Jiabao and Wu Bangguo, chairman of China's legislature, and visit Shanghai during his four-day visit.
About 30 Cabinet ministers and top South Korean businessmen were accompanying Roh.
China and South Korea have enjoyed stable and growing political ties since forming diplomatic relations in 1992, as well as booming trade and investment links.
The two are each other's third biggest trade partners, and North Korea has invested about $15 billion in China, much of it near their border.

NEW YORK (AFP) _ Half a century after its publication, John Steinbeck's ``East of Eden'' topped the New York Times bestseller list this week, leaving publishers bowing in gratitude to talk show queen Oprah Winfrey.
After a year-long hiatus, Oprah's Book Club is back, and the sales surge that greeted the selection of Steinbeck's 1952 classic shows she has lost none of her clout with the American public.
Penguin now has more than 1.3 million copies in print and has sold close to 813,000 copies nationwide in just three weeks.
Prior to the book's selection, ``East of Eden'' had averaged annual sales of around 40,000 copies.
``It really is the power of Oprah,'' Donelly said. ``People just really missed the book club.''
Oprah suspended her six-year-old club in April 2002, saying that her numerous other activities meant she didn't have enough time to read.
The decision sent a shudder through the publishing industry, which had come to rely on the selections that would guarantee a minimum 500,000-copy increase in sales for any chosen title
or an additional five million dollars in revenue.
At the time, Jane Friedman, CEO of HarperCollins, got a desperate e-mail.
``One of my colleagues had written to me one word:
The reincarnated book club will differ slightly from the original, offering just four or five selections a year with a focus on classic works, rather than books by living authors.
Concerns that classics may lack popular appeal were quickly dispelled by the phenomenal spike in ``East of Eden'' sales.
``We didn't see that before when Oprah had chosen other titles, before she dissolved her club.''
Its return has only served to underline the cultural influence exerted by the 49-year-old Winfrey who, earlier this year, became the first black woman ever to make Forbes magazine's list of global billionaires.
Cattle prices plummeted the day the show aired, and kept heading south for two weeks, in what beef traders called the ``Oprah Crash'' of 1996.

How is Japan seen in the eyes of the rest of the world?
Japan was a confident, youthful and ascendant nation, but also one that inspired nervousness, sometimes fear.
That was in the go-go 1980s, though.
And in a surprise twist, Wal-Mart would turn out to be a hero, not a villain.
Just such a drama will unfold in Japan after Wal-Mart opens its first megastore in the country in 2002.
The arrival will elicit cheers in some corners, protests elsewhere.
But its biggest symbolic impact will be to challenge outdated perceptions of Japan.
The launch will show how Asia's biggest economy has opened dramatically to global commerce, transforming itself in the minds of multinational corporations into one of the world's most important new markets.
Japan's cityscapes already glow with neon signs that prove the point:
Starbuck's, Toys "R" Us, Kinko's and even Cadillac.
Japanese Internet users routinely tap Yahoo, AOL and other Silicon Valley inventions to help them circulate in cyberspace.
"Twenty years ago, a Japanese man would have apologized if his son or daughter went to work for an American company," says outgoing U.S.
Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley.
"That's not true today."
Perceptions of Japan have changed just as fundamentally.
These days America's perceived rival in Asia is China, not Tokyo.
And the stereotypical Asian billionaire of the moment is the Hong Kong IT tycoon, Richard Li.
As Japan deregulates, foreign banks, brokerages and industrial groups are building subsidiaries and, incredibly, buying Japanese companies outright.
Across Asia, once the favored backyard for Japanese conglomerates, "tiger economies" are scrambling to reduce their dependence on Japan's capital and markets.
The new consensus is that Japan is in decline.
Japan could slip from its position as the world's third-largest economy behind the U.S. and Euroland by 2015.
The blowup could prove an embarrassment for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's government ahead of the Aug.
15 anniversary of the 1945 end of World War II.
Takami Eto, a 78-year-old three-time Cabinet minister who leads the third-largest faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, dismissed as ``a big lie'' estimates that the Japanese army killed as many as 300,000 civilians during the 1937-38 occupation of the Chinese city of Nanjing, then called Nanking.
``To say 300,000 people were killed in the Rape of Nanking is a pure fabrication, a big lie,'' Eto was quoted as saying Saturday (July 12) in a speech to a local party chapter, according to the Asahi newspaper and other national dailies.
Historians generally agree that at least 150,000 civilians were killed, but estimates can run as high as 300,000.
Some Japanese nationalist scholars and conservative lawmakers say the figures are inflated;
A museum at a shrine to Japan's war dead says the people of Nanjing were ``once again able to live their lives in peace'' after the Japanese army took over the city.
Eto has caused controversy before for similar remarks.
Neither he nor his aides could be reached Sunday to confirm the statements.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said there was ``ironclad evidence'' that the Nanjing massacre was ``an atrocity committed by Japanese militarism during the war of aggression in China.''
Any attempts to ``distort or deny history'' would be unsuccessful, the spokesman said in a statement.
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official warned that a failure to come to grips with the past could set back future relations between the two neighbors.
``We once again emphasize that without Japan's correct understanding of history, it is difficult to sincerely develop relations between the two countries.''
In 1995, Eto was forced to resign his Cabinet post as minister for coordination after saying Japan did ``some good things'' when it ruled Korea as a colony between 1910 and 1945.
Conservative politicians periodically rile Japan's neighbors by defending the country's record of aggression during the decades leading up to World War II. In 1994, then-Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano had to resign after calling the Rape of Nanking a ``fabrication.''

This should be the golden year for Kim Dae Jung, insist those who remain loyal.
His final year as the president of South Korea, they say, ought to be filled with national affection and appreciation.
But there is little love for Kim Dae Jung in his homeland.
Instead of a statesman retiring with respect, he is finishing his political life scorned or ignored by his countrymen.
He is reduced to being a figurehead brought out by aides to try to show that at 76, he is still healthy and relevant.
Parliament has bluntly rejected his last two nominees for prime minister, and lawmakers react to the president's most routine communications with disdain.
Kim resigned from his own Millennium Democratic Party to try to save it, but it is likely to split up anyway.
The party's nominee to replace him is going nowhere in the polls.
Worse, Kim's reputation for integrity

Two of his sons have been charged with influence peddling, seeming to follow the tradition of corruption that Kim had long preached against.
His closest political aide is among a dozen members of his inner circle who have been caught up in various scandals.
And though the president has not been implicated, South Korean voters say Kim must take the blame.
"He really disappointed the country.
He proved that he, too, is a politician, and all politicians are corrupt in this country," said one Seoul resident, Kang Byung Kyu, 27.
Nearly every South Korean president has been reviled at the end of his term, said Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador and former CIA station chief.
He helped save Kim from an execution attempt in 1973 by security agents of the South Korean dictatorship.
"Korean presidents fall victim to the expectation game that they are going to solve all the problems of the country," said Gregg in an interview.
"When they don't, people focus on what they haven't done, rather than what they have."

BEIJING (AP) _ Less than a year ago, Yang Bin was an orchid-selling sensation ranked as China's second-richest man.
He had a fortune estimated at $900 million, an equally outsize personality and a new appointment to lead a North Korean free-trade zone.
On Monday (July 14), Yang was sentenced to 18 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and bribery, a stunning downfall for a leader of China's new capitalist class.
``He's done,'' said Steve Tsang, director of the Asian Studies Center of St.
Yang's conviction came amid a Chinese crackdown on tax evasion and a series of investigations of leading business figures for possible tax and financial offenses.
A court in the northeastern city of Shenyang convicted Yang of all charges, including the illegal use of agricultural land, contract fraud, forgery of financial documents and offering and taking bribes, according to an assistant to his defense lawyer.
A woman who answered the phone at the court said she had ``no idea'' about the sentence and refused further comment.
She would only give her family name, Liu.
Yang, 40, is a Chinese-born Dutch citizen who says he made his fortune selling orchids.
His Shenyang-based company also was building a Dutch-themed housing development.
Forbes magazine estimated his fortune in 2001 $900 million, but his businesses have shrunk since his arrest and his current worth is unknown.
The official Xinhua News Agency also reported Yang's conviction.
It said the forgery involved US$216 million, while the bribes totaled US$50,000. The report gave few other details.
Though severe by Western standards, Yang's penalty was normal for China, which sometimes executes people for nonviolent offenses such as tax evasion or smuggling, said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist with City University of Hong Kong.
``I think the Chinese side certainly understands that the world is watching,'' he said.
In another high-profile case, Chinese and Hong Kong authorities are investigating Shanghai tycoon Chau Ching-gai and his companies, which are said to be suspected of misusing bank loans to play the stock market.
Chau, also known as Zhou Zhengyi, was estimated by Forbes to be worth US$320 million.
Such investigations have spread unease among China's new rich, many of whom have operated until recently with little regulation and who frequently are suspected of buying influence and exploiting political connections.
Bai Jianjun, a law professor at Peking University, said Yang's conviction was a message to Chinese capitalists.
``The message being sent is that the government will crack down on people who try to get rich illegally and buy power with money.
Yang moved to the Netherlands in 1987 and won political asylum after the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
He ran a textile business, returning to China with US$20 million to start a cut-flower business.
The Sinuiju Special Administrative Region was touted as an attempt by the North's communist regime to engage the outside world and revive its crippled economy following a capitalist model.
The rotund, chain-smoking Yang promised the 50-square-mile (130-square-kilometer) area would be ``totally capitalist.''
But China, which had encouraged North Korea to imitate its economic reforms, gave a lukewarm reception to Yang's appointment.
He was called in shortly after that for police questioning and accused of failing to pay millions of dollars in taxes.
It was unclear whether the summons was meant as a sign of Chinese displeasure with his appointment to serve Pyongyang.
For months, the government and state media were silent about Yang's fate and the investigation.
His employees said all communication had been cut off.
On Monday, state television showed Yang looking wan as he stood in his signature white polo shirt before three judges in the Shenyang court.
His lawyer, Tian Wenchang, said he already had appealed.
In our 1985 survey, only 32 per cent of Americans and 10 per cent of South Koreans called the Japanese "admirable."
In the new survey, 66 percent of Americans and 34 percent of South Koreans apply that term to the Japanese.
While 83 percent of Americans claimed that the Japanese took away markets and jobs from firms in the U.S. in 1985, 57 percent agree with that assertion today.
To be sure, Japan still faces image problems, old and new.
One recent criticism that Tokyo isn't doing enough to promote the regional economy stems from the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.
In China, however, the major bilateral beef remains Tokyo's failure to atone for Imperial Japan's bloody atrocities during World War II.
In Korea, which recently lifted its longstanding ban on Japanese books, films and music, wartime hatred can't keep the two cultures from drawing closer together.
Their visitor, in turn, gushed about leading man Han So Kyu, a South Korean Robert Redford whose recent spy thriller "Shuri" ranked among the top foreign films in Japan in 2000.
When, for example, the Gap introduced Japan to casual fashion in the early 1990s, khaki rapidly infiltrated most every wardrobe in Japan.
Then an unknown Japanese apparel company, Fast Retailing, produced cheaper, trendier casual wear that fit better and cost less.
The company's brand, Uniqlo, is now such a sensation in Japan that plans are in the works to open a string of stores in London, where the principal competitor will be the Gap.

But in less time than it takes most people to commute to work, you're at the doorstep of North Korea, communist alter ego of the buoyantly capitalist South.
This is Panmunjom, the ``truce village’’ and a meeting point of the two Koreas _ ground zero of what's left of the Cold War.
Brian Davis, who is stationed at the Demilitarized Zone.
He says it reminds him of ``Groundhog Day,’’ the American film in which a man trapped in time has to live the same day over and over.
``Groundhog Day’’ in its unfunny, nuclear-tinged Korean format marks a milestone on Sunday, July 27 _ the 50th anniversary of the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.
The guns may have fallen silent, but North Korea’s suspected attempts to develop atomic weapons highlight the potential for another, even more destructive conflict.
The armistice is a reminder of the failure to achieve a lasting peace, but it's also a date largely forgotten by South Koreans.
``It is not something to celebrate, just something to accept as a fact,’’ said Paik Sun-yup, a retired South Korean general who fought in the 1,127-day war that left up to 5 million people dead, wounded or missing, half of them civilians.
President Harry S. Truman’s attempt to contain the spread of communism without sparking a wider war with China or the Soviet Union cost 33,600 American lives in combat, with more than 8,000 missing.
About 140,000 South Korean soldiers and 3,200 from the 15 nations that joined the United States under the U.N. flag also died.
Communist military deaths _ North Koreans and the Chinese who intervened five months into the war _ are estimated in the hundreds of thousands.
Twelve hours later, the time the truce took effect will be marked with a 21-gun salute at U.S. military headquarters in Seoul.
North Korea’s propaganda machine casts the war as a victory, rather than the stalemate that it was.
Its government hasn't announced any commemorations, but is expected to do so with choreographed rallies and defiant, anti-American rhetoric.
These will likely be held in Pyongyang, 145 kilometers (90 miles) from the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ.
The war was one of stunning reversals.

Tools to combat global warming are ready, and many have developed more quickly than once predicted, but using them will require political fortitude, according to a major U.N. climate report.
It was approved over the weekend by a U.N. panel charged with looking for ways to mitigate climate change.
Known as "greenhouse" gases because they retain heat in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide and several other gases are thought by many scientists to be contributing to climate change.
"Advances are taking place in a wide range of technologies at different stages of development," the report said.
"The use and lifetime extension of nuclear power plants" could provide an important contribution to emission cuts, the report said.
A 1997 climate change treaty calls for nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the new report said that hundreds of technologies and techniques are available that could account for more than half of the proposed reductions.

The report also said the economic benefits could actually exceed the costs in many cases.
The other half, it said, could have a net direct cost of up to $100 per ton of carbon.
The report also endorsed giving nations wide latitude in deciding how to go about achieving reductions.
"It's out there, it's just a matter of liberating it, giving incentives to companies, removing the barriers to rolling out new technologies and changes in the system to make it all work."
The report noted that governments will have to encourage those changes.
"Most model results indicate that known technological options could achieve a broad range of atmospheric CO2 stabilization levels over the next 100 years or more, but implementation would require associated socio-economic and institutional changes," it said.
The second, released in Geneva in February, found that if warming through greenhouse gases was not slowed and then turned around in coming decades, the planet could see huge floods, spreading disease and social chaos.
The reports come as nations try to work out ways to implement the 1997 accord drafted in Kyoto, Japan.
The United States and Europe have been at odds, with Europe demanding significant, real cuts while the United States wants to encourage emissions trading and carbon "traps," which would store CO2 underground.

encouragement and advice around the clock.
Support is essential to losing weight, said Howard Rankin, a clinical psychologist who helps people lose weight.
Some doctors have been concerned about replacing face-to-face contact with virtual contact.
But a study in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that weight loss is possible over the Internet.
In the study of 91 overweight people, 46 were assigned to use a variety of online weight loss methods.
The participants had one face-to-face group meeting with a psychologist, and then had access to an online bulletin board.
They also received individualized advice from a diet expert via weekly e-mails and sent back exercise and food intake diaries.
People in the group lost about nine pounds in three months and kept it off for another three months.
This weight loss was comparable to that achieved in commercial programs, but not as good as losses in behavioral programs, where participants typically lost 20 pounds in 24 weeks.
The other half of the participants took part in one introductory group weight loss session led by a psychologist and were then given links to Internet weight loss Web sites.
Study subjects in that group lost almost four pounds in three months and kept it off for another three months.
"What's more important than short-term weight loss is how do you stay committed?
How do you keep going when you're not doing very well?"

Like a giant amoeba in the sky, the ozone hole above Antarctica has divided into two parts, which have spread away from the southernmost continent.
The surprising development is the first of its kind since NASA and other U.S. agencies began monitoring the ozone hole, a seasonal vortex high in the atmosphere, more than two decades ago.
Ozone is part of the stratosphere, which stretches from six to 30 miles above the Earth's surface.
Ozone shields the planet from dangerous ultraviolet solar rays, which can cause skin cancer.
In fact, without the ozone layer, life as we know it could not exist.
Recent satellite images reveal that the ozone hole had shrunk considerably compared with the previous two years.
Scientists caution that the data are insufficient to conclude that the fragile ozone layer is on the mend.
Moreover, the hole had dwindled in size before the split because of unusually warm temperatures in the atmosphere, according to NASA ozone scientist Paul Newman.
Between 1996 and 2001, the ozone hole reached more than 24 million square km.
The 2000 hole was the largest ever recorded at about 28 million square km, roughly three times the size of the United States.
Preliminary estimates from early September 2002 suggest that the seasonal hole had dwindled to about 15 million square km, according to NASA.
The air over the South Pole usually becomes coolest in August and September.
The frigid weather is associated with the formation of thin clouds, where the floating industrial chemicals eat up the fragile ozone molecules.
By October, the atmospheric region warms up and the hole begins to disappear.

E-mail will not overtake paper mail anytime soon in the home, in large part because women use the latter to control the flow of domestic information, according to a new study.
They haven't been designed for how people behave in the home."
Letters do more than communicate.
Women primarily manage the mail flow to control the household, the report said.
They are the ones who skim, sort and position letters in strategic locations for other people to see.
In many cases, for example, bills go where husbands will see them.
After a day or two, the women will take away the bill and pay it.
Paper mail offers many advantages over e-mail in a domestic setting.
It is easy to share unlike the inherently private e-mail.
The report surveyed more than 200 mail users in Britain and included experiments related to patterns of letter and e-mail sorting.

Falun Gong has been drawing attention in the West for the last two years.
Some Western China scholars are even praising it for the scientific basis of its principles.
Thus it was during my extensive reading for my latest book, "Watching the Tree," that I read the work of Li Hong-zhi, founder of Falun Gong.
I was greatly disappointed.
As a medical doctor as well as a writer, I found the work anything but rational or scientific.
His book "Zhuan Fa Lun" (Turning the Wheel of the Law), for example, challenges the very etiology of all diseases and denies even the microbial role in causing infections.
By suffering, writes Li, "he is repaying his debt.
Li also ascribes moral qualities to inanimate objects such as stone and wood.
Yet archeological evidence has shown that an agriculture-based civilization began about 11,000 years ago.
Then there are his references to "tall ancient buildings" discovered at the bottom of many oceans.
Therefore they must have been constructed long before our earth was covered by ocean waters.
Now who could have done this tens of millions of years ago?
We humans were not even monkeys then ..."

These are a few examples of Li's "scientific theories."
In his book, he also claims that he will implant a wheel in the abdomen of each of his disciples.
This wheel will keep on turning day and night and protect his followers from harm.
Some 100 pages later he gives the example of one his disciples who was involved in a traffic accident in Beijing.
However, at the moment of impact, the disciple's bicycle was suddenly dragged backwards by a mysterious force for almost two feet.
He immediately understood that his teacher Li Hong-zhi had protected him.
At that moment he saw a large wheel spinning just above his head, while the rod fell and pierced the ground immediately beside him.
You might or might not encounter them, but I will guarantee that you will have no danger.
This is what I will give you.
My saintly body will protect you until you are able to protect yourself."
Is this the reason he changed his date of birth to coincide with that of Buddha?
Among educated Chinese circles, Li's books are viewed with amusement and amazement.
Some of his followers in the United States and Canada may indeed be highly educated but they seem to have forgotten their knowledge of basic sciences.
Whatever the intellectual content of the Falun Gong philosophy, the Chinese government is certainly cracking down on Falun Gong supporters.
In China at present, suppression is merely providing Falun Gong members with a sense of solidarity.
Until the Beijing authorities recognize that there is a burning spiritual hunger among the Chinese people and set about providing legitimate facilities to fulfill this need, cults such as Falun Gong will continue to flourish.

In a new book called "The Omega-3 Connection," Stoll, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard argues that fish oils
The brain is an astonishing 60 percent fat, and it needs omega-3s to function properly.
In the last century, however, Americans have drastically reduced their intake of these oils, as we moved to diets based on processed foods.
It is impossible to reduce the cause to a single explanation
While omega-3s are important for everyone, an adequate supply is especially critical for infants and mothers.
No one doubts that omega-3 fatty acids help build and maintain brain tissue.
The American Heart Association has recently changed its dietary guidelines to recommend that adults eat at least two servings of fish each week.
Oily fish such as anchovies, mackerel and salmon have the most omega-3s.
Flaxseed, flaxseed oil, wheat germ and walnuts are good sources, too, as are dark greens such as spinach and kale.
You can also boost your omega-3 levels by switching from corn and soybean oil to canola oil.
Some hens are even fed flax and fishmeal to boost the levels of omega-3s in their egg yolks.
Beyond that, says Stoll, your best bet is supplements.
For general health, one to two grams of omega-3s a day should be sufficient.
To correct mood problems, two to five grams or more may be required.

More frequent and more devastating storms caused by climate change could cost $150 billion a year within the next ten years, possibly bankrupting financial services firms, a United Nations-backed report warned this week.
The report said a political framework for action on climate stability is essential, but said the Kyoto Protocol, under which many industrial nations except the United States committed to curb greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, does not go far enough.
Written on behalf of the UN Environment Program's (UNEP) finance initiative, the report said financial institutions could deliver market solutions to climate change, through carbon emissions trading and lower insurance premiums for cleaner companies.
Worldwide economic losses from natural disasters appear to be doubling every ten years, the report said, and called for action to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon.
The report said that while climate change is widely recognized as being a threat by insurers and reinsurers, their strategies towards it have been mixed.
Few insurers, for example, factor in climate change-related risks into their insurance premiums, the report said.
Fund managers do not currently regard climate change as an investment risk, though socially-responsible fund managers consider climate change when choosing their investments.
But the criteria used tend to be very crude, the report said.
The report called on financial services companies to raise awareness of the problem of climate change and to lead by example in corporate environmental management.
They should also provide products and services that support adaptation and mitigation of climate change.

"We were shocked by the result," said Neil MacDonald, vice president and director of research with Gartner Inc.
"What this means is a third of that time, roughly a third, is wasted."
In a self-commissioned survey, Gartner asked 330 business e-mail users in a variety of occupations and job titles about the contents of their e-mail in boxes.
The company found that the average e-mail user spends 49 minutes managing e-mail on the job each day, and a quarter spend more than an hour a day managing e-mail.
Gartner recommends that companies create a policy on e-mail etiquette to prevent the unnecessary e-mails and avoid lost productivity.
It looks and feels like it's legitimate e-mail because it's from your co-workers.
But it's not until you open it up that you realize it's a waste of time."

The government's goal of boosting organ donation is a good one.
"Let's work together," Tommy Thompson urged the nation.
"Why can't we solve the problem of who gets scarce organs instead of creating more angst amongst ourselves?"
Even if Thompson were to somehow double or even triple the number of organs Americans donate, he would still have to live with some angst.
The waiting lists for transplants are long and, in a graying society like ours, they grow longer every day.
Getting more organs is an ethically sound idea, but his new plan won't work.
The ideas Thompson presented about how to get more organs involve a partnership with private businesses to promote organ donation among employees, a medal to honor donor families, more teaching about organ donation in teen driver-education classes and a national donor card that makes it clear that anyone who has a card can serve as a donor even if a family member objects.
Americans are well aware of organ donation.
Public education campaigns have been letting people know about the "Gift of Life" for 30 years.
One more pamphlet at the office or a few more minutes in drivers ed is not going to boost the percentage of people who sign donor cards.
Moreover, as study after study has shown, signing a donor card is not a very effective way to ensure organ donation.
Nor will the ideas of medals and tougher donor cards do much good.
There are some steps that are likely to produce more organs to save lives.
First, remove financial barriers in access to transplants.
Poor people do not donate their organs at the same rate as the rich.
The reason is simple.
Poor people, many without health insurance, know that the rich have a much better chance of getting transplants than they do.
If Thompson really wants to get more organs available for transplant he must make sure that the rich and the poor have the same chance to get a transplant.
Second, treat organ donation as expected not heroic.
Thompson and President Bush should appear on national television with every governor and member of Congress.
Every one of them should fill out a donor card.
And each should do it simply because it is the right thing to do.
Shortage is always going to be a concern with organ transplantation.
But we can get more organs if the public believes that everyone has a fair chance to receive a transplant should they need one and that donation is not a matter of heroism but of common decency.
While the U.S. stock market has stagnated, many Asian markets have roared ahead Stock analysts say that one reason all of Asia's markets are ahead of the U.S. so far this year is that Asia had a long way to come back.

But few experts on the American workforce doubt that work has changed dramatically in recent years, increasing the pressures and the incentives to work harder.
in many cases creating the expectation that employees should be working all the time:
On their cell phones commuting to work, on their laptops and home computers in the evenings and on weekends.
We've also come to see the role of work in our lives in a dramatically different light as well.
A century ago people were less likely to define themselves by their occupations, and economists confidently predicted a future filled with leisure as machines replaced human labor.
Instead, work today has become more central than ever to people's lives, providing personal fulfillment and a sense of community, as well as a paycheck.
The prominence of work drives people to work harder, but it also leaves many feeling burnt out and fed up.
The decade-long economic boom drove many to work harder to take advantage of the good times, but even as the boom stalls, few experts expect the pressures and expectations on workers to ease.

Using a ground-based telescope to peer into a distant point of light, scientists have come up with a startling conclusion
the star ingested one or more of its own planets.
The surprise discovery should hasten the search for other such voracious stars, boosting the understanding of planetary evolution, the European researchers said.
Located in the constellation Hydra, the star is slightly hotter and larger than our sun and was recently discovered to possess a pair of giant planets.
Like most of the dozens of planets found around other stars, these two gas giants have bizarre orbits, in this case rather elongated ones unusually close to the central star.
Such planets are unlike any in our solar system and confound traditional theories of planetary formation.
Other explanations that account for the eccentric orbits also predict that some planets could plummet into their host stars, a hypothesis that the new observation seems to confirm, the scientists said.
Using the European Southern Observatory telescope in Atacama, Chile, the astronomers detected the presence of a rare variety of lithium in the star.
The fragile metal would have been destroyed in the early, explosive evolutionary stages of this particular kind of star, which like our own is rich in heavy metals.
The star, known as HD82943, could have swallowed either a gas giant twice the mass of Jupiter or a small rocky one three times the mass of Earth, the astronomers estimated in their report, published in the May 10 issue of the journal Nature.
Scientists have discovered more than 60 planetary systems beyond our own in recent years, using powerful telescopes to measure the wobble brought about by orbiting planets on their host stars.
Asian Internet users flocked to pornographic Web sites, with Singaporean executives and South Korean students topping the list, Some 10.7 million South Koreans headed to adult sites, a hefty 72 percent jump from the year before, the Internet measurement firm said.

Software piracy grew in 2000 for the first time in half a decade and 37 percent of the programs used by businesses worldwide are illegal copies.
The Business Software Alliance, an organization of productivity software companies such as Adobe and Microsoft, has conducted the study since 1994.
The Asia-Pacific nations, where more than half of all programs in use last year were stolen, are increasingly accounting for worldwide piracy.
The Business Software Alliance announces 159 software piracy settlements worldwide, totaling more than $6.2 million. Thirty-six of those settlements
in which companies paid software companies to settle claims that they were using unlicensed software
are in the United States.
Software companies lost more than $4 billion in 2000 due to piracy in the Asia-Pacific region.
Eastern Europe has had the highest piracy rate each year, with 63 percent of its software illegally copied in 2000.
Many companies use authentication codes printed on CD cases of programs like Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office but software pirates find them on illegal Web sites.
In response to this threat, Microsoft's upcoming Office XP and Windows XP products will require an online "product activation" sequence that uses a combination of a software serial code and a number created by scanning the hardware of a person's computer.
If the customer doesn't activate the program, it will stop working within several days.
But like copy-proof "key disks" of the past, these methods can frustrate legitimate buyers and are frequently overcome by industrious software pirates.
Even though Windows XP hasn't been released, there already are downloadable programs that work to disable its copy protection.

Japan's economic outlook got a boost with figures showing business activity rose 1.2 percent in March from the previous month.
The increase is the first in a year and is viewed as a further sign that the Japanese economy has bottomed out after months of stagnation.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that he saw signs of an economic comeback in the recent strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar.
Engine problems stranded two men on a boat in the Atlantic one recent afternoon.
They could see land but had no idea where they were.
So one called 911 on his cell phone.
The men were lucky to be along the coast of Rhode Island, where emergency operators have more power than most of their counterparts in America to help people calling from wireless phones.
An operator instantly received the boaters' precise latitude and longitude and passed the coordinates to the Coast Guard, which picked the men up safely before dark.
This is not heroic by comic book standards, but it's an ideal moment in the world of public safety.
It's also how wireless 911 calls are supposed to work everywhere.
Six years ago, the Federal Communications Commission ordered phone companies to make it possible by 2005.
But while about half of 911 calls come from cell phones
a percentage that increases every year
meeting the FCC's demand for callers' location information has been excruciatingly difficult.
Phone companies have squabbled over details, and public safety agencies are short on resources.
Several places are scheduled to reach that level soon, and FCC officials and phone companies say the 2005 deadline is still attainable.
But it probably will take a more efficient and cooperative effort.

Americans are marking the three-day Memorial Day weekend with alerts about terrorism ringing in their ears.
As the FBI warned that terrorists may try to use small aircraft for suicide attacks, the nation's nuclear power plants were placed on a heightened state of alert.
Alerts involved everything from tall apartment buildings to the Statue of Liberty to scuba divers and subways.

on a range of issues, including counter-terrorism, regional emergencies and arms control.
Americans will celebrate Memorial Day on Monday, May twenty-eighth.
The holiday honors the men and women who died fighting in wars for the United States.
The idea of celebrating such a day began after the American Civil War in the 1860's.
It was the idea of a daughter of a Union officer who had been killed in battle.
She described a German tradition of placing flowers on soldiers’ burial places each spring.
She said Americans should do the same.
The commander of the soldiers’ organization agreed.
He ordered that May thirtieth, 1868, be named “Decoration Day” to honor soldiers who had died in the Civil War.
It was also called “Memorial Day.”
A confederate Memorial Day was observed in some southern states.
It was the first state to make it a holiday.
Congress made it a national holiday in 1888.
After World War One, Memorial Day became a day to remember those who died in all the nation’s wars.
Today, Americans celebrate the Memorial Day holiday in different ways.
Towns and cities hold parades over Memorial Day weekend.

Sex education programs do not speed up teenagers' experimentation with sex, and might actually delay it, a study said.
"Programs do not increase sexual activity," said Douglas Kirby, author of the study.
"They do not hasten the onset of sex.
They do not increase the frequency of sex, nor do they increase the number of sexual partners."
Four out of 10 girls in the United States get pregnant at least once before age 20, according to the study.
There are nearly 1 million teen pregnancies each year.
Teen pregnancy and birth rates declined in the 1990s but the United States still has the highest rates of pregnancy and birth of any comparable country.
The report singled out eight programs that were found to effectively communicate the joint messages of abstinence and safe sex.
Five of those were sex education programs, two were community service programs that included discussion session, and one was an intensive program combining sex education, health care and tutoring.
All the programs shared common elements, Kirby said.
"They focused very directly upon sexual behavior," he said.
They focused upon changing sexual behavior."
Kirby said the programs also gave clear messages about sexual behavior and emphasized abstinence as the safest way to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
Researchers could draw no definite conclusion about why certain programs seemed more effective that others.
But they agreed that candid conversation does work, and simply talking about sex to teenagers does not encourage sexual activity.
"There still is no magic bullet to reducing teen pregnancy," Kirby said.

The United Nations says at least 500 million new jobs will be needed during the next ten years to help support the world’s workforce.
The UN International Labor Office published the World Employment Report a few months ago.
It says the new jobs will be needed to help reduce unemployment around the world by half.
The International Labor Office estimates that 160 million people did not have jobs at the end of last year.
Most of these people were seeking jobs for the first time.
Among them, about 110 million live in developing countries.
The report also estimates about 500 million workers around the world have jobs, but they are not paid enough money.
They earn less than one American dollar a day.
This is called “underemployment.”
The rate at which people enter the world’s workforce is expected to slow during the next ten years.
However, the UN estimates about 460 million people will join the world’s workforce by 2010.
More than half of these new workers will be from Asia.
Experts say the need for jobs depends greatly on whether the world economy continues to expand.
If it does, the International Labor Office says information technology and communications will offer the most promising chances for work.
Duncan Campbell is the economist who supervised the World Employment Report.
He says technology is important.

Their strength in the race to deliver broadband service is illustrated by an ad from a unit of cable company Cox Communications.
"Who unplugged the Internet?"
and "Is your DSL provider taking you to the InterNOT?"
When a Wisconsin Internet business stopped providing service, Charter Communications cable offered disconnected customers a chance to subscribe to its Internet access "without any pain."
That meant giving significant discounts, so customers could switch over seamlessly.
Cox Communications offered to install its service for free for consumers left without their DSL service.
Cox says it has seen call volume go up by as much as 100 percent in two of the markets where the "unplugged" ad has run.
Cable already is well ahead of its telephone, satellite and wireless rivals in snagging customers.
Cable is also a known quantity, said AT&T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong, who heads the nation's largest cable business.
Cable companies already enjoy a comfortable lead in offering high-speed access, with 4.7 million customers in the United States, according to the Yankee Group.
About 2.2 million people subscribe to DSL service from a phone company or other Internet provider, while 98,000 customers hook up to high-speed Internet via satellite.
Still, some cable operators warn against resting on past successes or discounting the power of rivals.
The nation's four Bell companies, delivering DSL service over phone lines, remain in a prime position to capture customers in their markets.

The mosquito-borne West Nile virus, which can cause encephalitis and result in death, is expected to eventually spread across the United States, federal health officials said.
Mosquitoes spread the virus to birds, animals and humans.
Since 1999, West Nile virus has made 74 people severely ill and caused nine deaths.
All of the victims were in New York and New Jersey.
Studies show that only one in 100 to one in 150 people who are infected actually go on to develop symptoms.
The virus, first identified in 1937 in the West Nile region of Uganda, was detected in the United States two years ago after birds and humans in the New York City area were bitten by infested mosquitoes.
Since 1999, the virus has been detected in 12 states and the District of Columbia
So far this year, it's been detected in dead crows in New York, Connecticut, Maryland and New Jersey.
The CDC has advised all state health departments to be on alert for signs of the virus.
In response, Georgia has formed a West Nile Task Force.
Individual counties are trapping mosquitoes and analyzing them.
When West Nile virus activity is detected in an area, residents are alerted to take precautionary steps to protect themselves.
Health officials suggest citizens who find dead birds or animals contact the local Board of Health.
The report from the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) helped generate a last-week rally on Wall Street.
But economists cautioned that the run of good news in recent weeks has signaled only a slower deterioration of conditions with few signs of any real strength.
The closely-watched purchasing managers report indicated that the manufacturing sector declined for an 11th straight month in June, although the overall index reading of 44.7 percent was the best showing since November 2000 and far better than the 42.3 percent expected by analysts on average.
Any reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is contracting.
Because manufacturing accounts for slightly less than one-fifth of the economy, the overall index figure would be consistent of annual GDP growth of 0.7 percent, according to the NAPM.
“The economy is still not showing any strength, but at least things aren't getting any worse, and that's a precondition for recovery,” said Mark Vitner, a First Union economist.
Blue-chip stock prices rose, with the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 91.32 points to 10,593.72.
Treasury bond prices also rose, pushing down long-term interest rates, in part because the purchasing managers index showed that commodity prices fell in June, reflecting an outlook for continued low inflation.
A South Korean patrol boat was sunk that left at least four South Korean sailors dead and 18 others injured, officials in Seoul say.

The extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago may have been caused by a kind of astronomical "wobble" in Earth's and Mercury's solar orbits, according to a new theory by a group of California scientists.
Scientists have long speculated that a giant celestial body slammed into ancient Earth.
The impact, known by scientists as K-T, threw so much dust into the atmosphere that the resulting darkness killed plants that many dinosaurs relied on for food.
The dinosaurs essentially starved to death.
But it's unclear if the object that hit the Earth was a comet or an asteroid.
Using computer models, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) professors and researchers tracked planetary orbits as far back as 250 million years ago.
During the Cretaceous period, gravitational pushes and pulls with the Sun and other planets created a wobble in the Earth's orbit, according to the UCLA team's models.
That wobble, in turn, may have caused the planet Mercury's orbit to wobble.
Gravitational effects of the two celestial wobbles might have forced a large asteroid to break away from the asteroid belt and smash into Earth.
There are thought to be hundreds of thousands of asteroids in our system ranging in size from small pieces to as large as entire mountains.
Most of them are floating in the asteroid belt, an elliptical plane located between Mars and Jupiter.
Mark Bailey, director of the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland, said he is also studying what might have hit the Earth and driven the dinosaurs to extinction.
"I'm skeptical," Bailey said of the theory.
"It seems to me that this is a very long chain of assumptions."
But Bailey said he could not rule out the theory altogether.
that smashed into the Earth 65 million years ago.
But Varadi, a 20-year veteran researcher, said that if he had to guess whether the object that hit the Earth was a comet or an asteroid, he would choose the asteroid theory.

A new report on heart disease among American males says a man's race and where he lives can make a huge difference in his chances of dying, with blacks and those living in economically underdeveloped areas most at risk.
The study found similar differences when statistics were broken down according to location, with much higher death rates in economically depressed areas.
The CDC intends for the new report to be used to identify which parts of the country are doing relatively well in heart disease prevention and treatment and which places are most disadvantaged.
The report looked at geographic variation in heart disease deaths for U.S. men over age 35 between 1991 and 1995.
Geographically, death rates by county ranged from a low of 377 per 100,000 men to a high of 1,102 per 100,000.
Hardest hit were men living in Appalachia, the Ohio-Mississippi River Valley, the Mississippi Delta and the eastern Piedmont and coastal regions of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
While the overall death rate from heart disease is 675 per 100,000 men, when broken into racial and ethnic groups the rate ranges from a high of 841 per 100,000 for African-American men down to 372 per 100,000 for Asian and Pacific Islander men.
The report also found African-American men are more likely to die from heart disease at a young age than are men of other racial groups.
It estimates that about 40 percent of deaths due to heart disease in African-American men occur before age 65.

China has shut down nearly 2,000 Internet cafes across the country and has ordered 6,000 to suspend operations and make changes.
Anonymous cybercafes are popular because they allow people to evade tough content laws, whose infringement on a personal homepage or message board authorities are likely to track to its source.
More than 56,800 Internet cafes or bars have been inspected during a probe that began in April, the newspaper said.
It said police closed 53 Internet bars and ordered 59 others to suspend operations for "rectification and improvement" in Nanjing in the eastern province of Jiangsu.
Internet bars have mushroomed in China since first appearing in big cities in 1997.
Mini-cyber bars can now be found in bookstores, barbershops, clothes stores, and the butcher's.

She was reported have been shot three times in the head and twice in the body and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.
Hundreds of people have been gathering outside her home as news of her death spread.
Her story was the subject of numerous films and books, but first came to international prominence in the 1994 movie "Bandit Queen", directed by Shekhar Kapur.
Born into a poor family from the low-caste Mallah community, Devi was forced into marriage at age 11 to a man more than 20 years her senior.
She ran away from her abusive husband and was kidnapped several years later by lower-caste bandits who roamed the lawless Chambal Ravines in India's central Hindu heartland.
Two bandits shot dead Devi's gang leader lover and took her their village of where she was confined in a shack and allegedly gang raped by local men.
She escaped three weeks later only to return on Valentine's Day 1981 as the head of her own gang, whom she allegedly told to kill 22 high-caste Hindu men in revenge for her rape.

A two-kilometre-wide asteroid, dubbed 2002 NT7, is travelling at 28 kilometres per second and there is a chance, that it could hit our planet on February 1, 2019.
Astronomers believe the asteroid could be the most threatening object yet detected in space.
It is the first object to be given a positive value, of 0.06, on the Palermo scale of potential threat posed by asteroids, although scientists said further calculations were needed to pin the precise path of 2002 NT7.

Dramatic new evidence has emerged concerning the final hours of "Otzi", the Bronze Age hunter whose frozen body was found in the Alps in 1991.
The chance discovery of the excellently preserved 5,300-year old corpse
Numerous theories have been advanced, including that he was killed in an avalanche, or simply died of exhaustion.
Now, however, Italian scientists have revealed that he met a more violent end, killed by an arrow.
"Now research on the Iceman starts over."
The startling discovery was made last week using a technique known as computerised tomography.
This uses X-rays to produce a multi-dimensional image of the body, and revealed a hitherto unnoticed flint arrowhead embedded beneath the Iceman's left shoulder.
The 21mm-long arrow, whose angle of entry suggests it was shot from below, shattered Otzi's scapula and ripped through nerves and major blood vessels, paralysing his left arm and causing massive internal bleeding.
It ended up buried six centimetres beneath the skin, close to his left lung.
"There is a whole series of new implications.
All the things that have been published over the last eight years are wrong.
The story needs to be rewritten."
The body, whose age at time of death is estimated at between 45 and 50 years old, was found by two German mountaineers in a glacier on the Italian-Austrian border.

The IBM PC was introduced to the world 20 years ago at a press conference in New York on August 12, 1981.
Evolving from the MITS Altair computer and taking cues from early PCs such as the Apple II, the IBM PC
and the story behind its development
provided a foretaste of how the whole tech industry took shape.
The IBM PC originated not at Big Blue's Armonk, New York, headquarters but at its small division in Boca Raton, Florida, which was headed by IBM veteran Bill Lowe.
It was Lowe who proposed to IBM's top brass that they build a personal computer made of components provided by outsiders, bucking IBM's long-standing practice of using its own hardware and software.
A one-year deadline was established that would have been impossible to meet operating under IBM's traditionally proprietary ways.
Lowe says IBM's decision to buy instead of build was driven by economics.
Lowe says the proposal to sell the PC through retail channels led to the decision to go with an open architecture.
"Distributors would have to service the product themselves and retailers would accommodate the product only if we used non-IBM hardware," he says.
One IBM engineer involved in the development of the PC, Dave Bradley, thinks this decision changed the face of the industry.
"By going with an open system you invite the rest of the industry to participate.
For example, other companies such as Lotus were able to develop applications," Bradley says.
This paved the way for open hardware standards and, eventually, the opportunity for thousands of companies in the PC sector.
Intel was one of the many companies that flourished.
IBM selected Intel's 8088 processor for the system chiefly because it was the only 16-bit processor available that had an 8-bit bus.
Another company that benefited from the open system was Microsoft.
In the early 1980s the most common OS in non-Apple PCs was CP/M, developed by Digital Research in Pacific Grove, California.
Microsoft, then a small software company in Bellevue, Washington, seized on this opportunity.
Co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen assured IBM that in addition to developing the Basic programming language for the IBM PC, Microsoft could provide an operating system.
The International Monetary Fund, seeking to contain a deepening economic crisis said it would provide $30 billion in loans to Brazil.
It is one of the biggest bailout packages in the history of the global lending organization.
The 15-month agreement followed intense talks between the IMF and Brazil as Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was wrapping up a fact-finding mission to the region.

Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage married Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, witnessed by family and close friends, The couple recited wedding vows at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel on the Big Island of Hawaii.
This is Presley's third wedding;
she was married previously It was the second marriage for Cage, speaking at the end of an economic forum designed to reassure Americans that he's paying attention to the economy, said that he is confident the U.S. economy is on the mend.
But Microsoft did not have an OS of its own.
Racing against IBM's tight deadline, Allen got in touch with a local hardware vendor that did have an OS, Seattle Computer Products.
Microsoft executive Jeff Raikes remembers what the industry was like when he joined the company in 1981.
"The software business was dominated by hardware companies, and everybody thought they would just come in and wipe us out," Raikes says.
"People forget that Microsoft took a huge bet to think that an independent operating system and programming language would be successful."
"We put a real premium on schedule.
They were able to provide an operating system on the schedule we needed," he says.
After shipping in October 1981, the roaring success of the IBM PC meant that PCs were ready to make the leap onto corporate desktops.
"IBM legitimized the notion of the PC," Raikes says.
Soon IBM compatibles from Compaq and software applications such as Lotus 1-2-3 appeared, and the PC industry shifted into full gear.
Summarizing the success of the IBM PC, Bradley says, "Clearly it was a product whose time had arrived."
TERABYTES OF STORAGE:
The 1.44MB floppy might survive longer than we think, but by 2010 the traditional floppy, superfloppies such as the Zip, and even CD burners will disappear as DVD burners become stock items.
And multigigabyte hard drives will go by the wayside as multiterabyte drives will be required to hold the Microsoft bloatware of a decade out.
64-BIT CPU UNDER THE HOOD:
The typical configuration of today's PC includes a 32-bit processor running at 1.0GHz or faster, 128MB of RAM, and 128KB of Level 2 cache.
A limited number of of 64-bit desktop PCs also are expected to ship in 2001, following the delivery of Intel's 64-bit Itanium processor.
In 10 years, we'll all be using 64-bit systems with 64GB or more of RAM and several megabytes of cache to process the voice and video streaming.
Ten years out, everyone will be using a flat-panel screen, typically 18 inches diagonally, but it will sport a built-in digital camera for full-motion videoconferencing.
Keyboards and mice will be wireless, and they'll incorporate fingerprint readers for authorizing the user.
And these input methods will be supplemented by speech recognition, which, along with biometric security, will be built into the OS of future.
This OS will be either a Windows derivative or a Mac/Linux fusion.
In the future, Bluetooth and 802.11 wireless LANs will have evolved into something that is secure.

When Maureen Reagan first noticed a spot on the back of her right thigh about five years ago, she wasn't too concerned.
But then it started looking “gushy,” and Reagan knew it was time to see a doctor.
When she did, in the winter of 1996, the nuisance became malignant melanoma.
After surgery and a year of wrenching treatment with the drug Interferon, Reagan was optimistic.
But last fall the melanoma was back.
By spring, doctors had detected the cancer in her groin, right arm, liver and a rib; by July, it had invaded her brain.
Despite aggressive treatment and a crusading spirit, Reagan died last week at home.
Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in Americans between the ages of 25 and 29 when other leading cancers, like lung and colon, rarely occur.
This year, the American Cancer Society estimates, 51,400 people will be diagnosed with melanoma and 7,800 will die from it.
But doctors say those numbers could be slashed if Americans knew more about how to protect themselves against the disease, and if they were better informed about how to detect it in its earliest stages, when the odds for long-term survival are excellent.
The hunt is on for better ways to attack melanoma and even stop it in its tracks.
But for now, says Dr.
The main preventable cause of melanoma is excessive sun exposure.
So doctors advise avoiding or limiting sun exposure from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and using protective clothing and sunscreen with an SPF rating of at least 15.
Severe sunburns in childhood may particularly increase the risk of melanoma in later life, so children in particular should be protected, doctors say.
When melanoma is caught in its earliest stages and removed, it is highly curable.
Untreated, melanoma can spread quickly into the body from the skin.

Astronomers announced the discovery of the first solar system other than our own where multiple planets travel around a star in circular   orbits.
Of the roughly 70 planets found so far outside our solar system, most travel in tight, erratic orbits around their stars.
However, the two planets around the star 47 Ursae Majoris both travel in nearly circular orbits at a distance that, in our solar system, would place them beyond Mars but within the orbit of Jupiter.
Sharks attacked three surfers off Florida's upper east coast, a few miles from where three men were bitten the previous day.

Nearly four out of five of the crimes Child prostitution accounted for some 400 cases, while 213 others violated child protection laws.
The death toll from the West Nile virus has risen to 16 as the disease continues to spread across the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The mosquito-borne virus has now infected 371 people, including the first patients in Maryland, Nebraska and Virginia.
The virus has been spreading quickly westward, with officials fearing it will soon reach the West Coast.
West Nile has now been found in horses and birds The United States can't wait before taking action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Vice President Dick Cheney said.

These "time costs" increased with the complexity of the chores:
It took longer for subjects to switch between more complicated tasks.
"People in a work setting," says Rubinstein, "who are banging away on word processors, at the same time they have to answer phones and talk to their co-workers or bosses, they're doing switches all the time.
' But even if you have a cell phone that's not held by hand and can be dialed by voice, you still have a really big conflict because when you're driving you need to be looking at various different places, you need to be reading signs, you need to be talking to yourself about those in order to make decisions about where to go with your car."
That suggests that a very simple conversation on the phone while driving a car might not draw too much concentration.
But if the conversation becomes difficult or emotionally charged or mentally taxing, it draws more attention and more mental resources away from your primary task, which is driving the car:
You're more likely to have an accident."
North Korea is "armed to the teeth" with weapons of mass destruction and selling its weapons and missile technology to any state willing to pay for it, a top U.S. official has warned.
Denouncing the North Korean leadership as "an evil regime," Undersecretary of State John Bolton said that unless the secretive communist state halted its weapons exports and development of weapons of mass destruction it would risk losing what international assistance it was currently receiving.

Focusing on the United States, Richard Estes, co-author of the study, said the findings debunked many myths about what kind of children are involved in "the nation's least recognized epidemic."
"One of the other myths is that this is a problem of poor, inner city, mostly minority youth.
We cannot confirm that to be the case, but rather just the opposite."
Estes said most of these children are runaways and homeless kids who trade survival sex for food, shelter and clothing on the streets of U.S. cities.
However, some children in the United States also engage in commercial sex while living at home.
"The majority of these children trade sex for money or for more expensive clothes or other consumer goods," Estes said.
"Most of the customers of these children are members of their own junior and senior high school peer groups."
Many of those who solicit children for sex are men who are married with children of their own, the study reported.
The report called for the earlier identification and more intensive supervision of sexually offending adults and juveniles.
"We've got to pay closer attention to the problem including what's happening in our own homes and neighborhoods with kids who we think we're taking good care of."

Bangladesh's government raised fuel prices by up to 67 percent Tuesday, adding to the cost of living for Bangladeshis, most of whom live on less than $1 a day.
Bangladesh imports crude oil and petroleum products, which are then sold at subsidized rates.
"We took the decision to raise fuel prices, finding no other way to reduce revenue losses," M. Tamim, an aide to Bangladesh's interim government, said.
Under the new rates, which started immediately, a liter of premium grade gasoline will be raised 34 percent to 90 takas ($3.42 per gallon).
Diesel and kerosene prices were raised 37.5 percent to 55 takas ($3.04 a gallon).
Liquefied petroleum gas mostly used for cooking in areas without piped gas supply saw the largest hike of 66.67 per cent.
Fuel prices were last raised in April 2007, when a barrel of crude oil cost about $60 a barrel on the international market.
Recently, crude has spiked above $140 a barrel. Bangladesh has already seen increases in transport, commodity and food prices in recent months.
John McCain and Barack Obama locked in a statistical dead heat in the race for the White House.
With just over four months remaining until voters weigh in at the polls, the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey out Tuesday indicates that among registered voters nationwide, Obama holds a 5-point advantage over the Arizona senator, 50 percent to 45 percent.
That represents little change from a similar poll one month ago, when the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee held a 46 to 43 percent edge over McCain.
CNN polling director Keating Holland notes that Tuesday's survey confirms what a string of national polls released this month have shown:
Obama holds a slight advantage over McCain, though not a big enough one to constitute a statistical lead.
"Every standard telephone poll taken in June has shown Obama ahead of McCain, with nearly all of them showing Obama's margin somewhere between 3 and 6 points," Holland said. "In most of them, that margin is not enough to give him a lead in a statistical sense, but it appears that June has been a good month for Obama.
But the new CNN/ORC poll shows that the race gets even tighter when the two most prominent third-party presidential candidates are considered.
In a four-way matchup that includes independent candidate Ralph Nader and Libertarian candidate Bob Barr, Obama's lead over McCain dwindles to 3 percentage points, 46 percent to 43 percent.
(Nader registers 6 percent, and Barr gets 3 percent.)
"A useful rule of thumb is that third-party candidates in November get no more than half the support polls show them having in June or July," Holland said.
One-quarter of all registered voters say Obama lacks patriotism, according to the poll.
That breaks down to 10 percent of Democrats, 29 percent of independents and 40 percent of Republicans who say Obama lacks patriotism.
Starbucks Corp. said Tuesday it will close 600 stores in the United States in the next year and cut back the number of new stores it had planned to open.
Starbucks said 70 percent of the stores slated to be closed had opened since the start of the 2006 fiscal year.
The total includes 100 previously announced store closures.
The company expects charges between $328 million and $348 million related to the closures, including a charge of $200 million in the third quarter.
Once those underperforming stores have shut down a process the company said will happen gradually from now until the first half of 2009 Starbucks said it expects the change to boost earnings by $100 million a year.
Starbucks said it will try to place workers from closed stores in remaining Starbucks.
(CNN) Australians have been warned: Don't get caught annoying the crowds when they gather here later this month to see the pope.
New regulations give police and emergency services workers the power to order anyone to stop behavior that "causes annoyance or inconvenience to participants in a World Youth Day event," according to a New South Wales state government gazette.
The laws will apply in dozens of areas of downtown Sydney including the city's landmark opera house, train stations and city parks that are designated venues for World Youth Day, a Catholic evangelical festival at which Pope Benedict XVI will conduct mass and lead prayer meetings when he visits.
Violators can face a fine of over $5,000 under the regulations, which critics are calling a heavy-handed blow to free speech.
Nearly 200,000 pilgrims have registered to take part in the July 15-20 World Youth Day festival, and organizers say more are expected before the event starts.

MADRID, Spain (CNN) &#8212; Saudi Arabia on Tuesday ruled out further increases in crude production following its June 23 announcement that it would pump an extra half-million barrels a day.
In an interview with CNN, Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said he was troubled by the current high levels of petroleum prices, but added, "We have nothing to do with prices where they are today.
Asked whether Saudi Arabia, OPEC¡¯s leading producer, would open its taps to its estimated maximum capacity of 11 million barrels a day, al-Naimi asked rhetorically, ¡°Where is the buyer?
Saudi officials told CNN later that they stand ready to boost their production if the demand materializes.
Orders for August start coming in this week, and those figures might indicate whether that demand exists.
Sen. Barack Obama said Tuesday that Washington needs to draw on faith-based groups to solve the challenges the country is facing, ¡°from saving our planet to ending poverty.

Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain focused on crime Tuesday in his campaign appearances, saying that Congress ¡°needs to get its priorities straight¡± so that law enforcement officials can have the resources they need.
¡°Funds distributed by the Department of Justice are too often earmarked according to their value to the re-election of members of Congress instead of their value to police,¡± McCain said at the National Sheriffs¡¯ Association¡¯s 68th annual conference in Indianapolis, Indiana.
VIENNA, Austria (CNN) Joyous Spanish fans partied hard into the early hours Monday morning after their side defeated Germany 1-0 to claim their first major football title in 44 years.
Fernando Torres scored the only goal of the European Championship final in Vienna Sunday, sliding the ball past German keeper Jens Lehmann after 33 minutes as the Spaniards took a grip on the match which they never let slip.
Spanish fans in Austria and back home went wild on the final whistle, with fireworks being left off and the sound of car horns filling the air in Madrid
Firefighters had to douse the celebrating crowds with water as the temperature neared 30 degrees Celsius in Madrid after the final whistle, The Associated Press reported.
"We suffered, but in the end, it was worth the pain," he said.
News agency Efe reported that 25 people were hospitalized in the Spanish capital, with one person in critical condition with head injuries.
In all, emergency services treated 120 people.
Boston Red Sox manager Terry Francona declined comment Monday on a report the team received a mailed threat targeting black and Latin players.
The Boston Herald, citing unidentified sources, reported the threat was believed to be postmarked in Memphis, Tenn., and that a suspect believed to be from Baltimore but living in the Memphis area was being sought.
The newspaper said the team increased security for its three-game series against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I will not discuss that out of respect to everyone concerned," Francona said Monday night. "It's not something we can address.
No names of players were identified in the newspaper report.
Red Sox slugger David Ortiz said he first learned of the threat from reporters.
I don't think they'll be anything crazy coming out of it.
Boston and Tampa Bay were playing for the first time since a bench-clearing brawl between the teams at Fenway Park on June 5. The Herald said the threat was not believed to be related to any bad blood between the Red Sox and Rays, who are battling for first place in the AL East.
The online hangout Facebook is getting more serious about grammar.
No more should users see jarringly incorrect declarations such as "Debbie changed their profile picture.
Users who haven't specified their gender in their Facebook profiles will be asked to do so in the coming weeks.
That way, Facebook doesn't have to default to "their" or the made-up word "themself," as it had been doing.
While not knowing someone's gender poses grammatical challenges in English, it has created even larger headaches as Facebook expands to other languages, where a gender-neutral option isn't available in plural form.
"People who haven't selected what sex they are frequently get defaulted to the wrong sex entirely," Naomi Gleit, a Facebook product manager, wrote Friday in a company blog.
Transgendered people and other users who find the male-female distinction too limiting will still have the option of removing gender entirely from their profiles.
PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN) Cathy Campbell did a double-take and tapped the brakes when she spotted what appeared to be a pointy-edged box lying in the road just ahead.
The optical illusion is one of the latest innovations being tested around the country to discourage speeding.
A smaller experiment two years ago in the Phoenix area found the faux speed bumps slowed traffic, at least temporarily.
Now, in a much bigger test that began earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to find out if the markers can also reduce pedestrian accidents.
The fake bumps are being tested on a section of road in a business and residential area in Philadelphia's northeastern corner.
But soon they will also be popping up or looking that way on 60 to 90 more streets where speeding is a problem.
The 3-D markings are appealing because, at $60 to $80 each, they cost a fraction of real speed bumps (which can run $1,000 to $1,500) and require little maintenance, said Richard Simon, deputy regional administrator for the highway safety administration.
On one of three streets tested in the Phoenix trial, the percentage of drivers who obeyed the 25 mph speed limit nearly doubled.
But the effect wore off after a few months.
"Initially they were great," said the Phoenix Police traffic coordinator, Officer Terry Sills. "Until people found out what they were.
VILNIUS, Lithuania (CNN) Unidentified hackers broke into several hundred Lithuanian Web sites over the weekend, plastering them with communist symbols, government officials said Monday.
The hackers posted Soviet symbols the hammer and sickle, as well as the five-pointed star and scathing messages with profanities on Web sites based in the ex-Soviet nation, officials said.
"More than 300 private and official sites were attacked from so-called proxy servers located in territories east of Lithuania," said Sigitas Jurkevicius, a computer specialist at Lithuania's communications authority.
Many believe the attacks were a backlash against legislation approved by lawmakers two weeks ago banning the public display of Soviet and communist symbols.
President Valdas Adamkus signed the law Friday.
The law prohibits the public display of the Soviet flag, military uniforms and the five-pointed Soviet star, as well as the playing of the Soviet national anthem.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, staying above $140 a barrel, amid concerns about tensions between Iran and Israel and a weakening dollar.
Oil also rose on expectations the European Central Bank will likely raise interest rates at its next meeting on Thursday, a move that would help strengthen the euro against the dollar, Shum said.
As the dollar has weakened, investors have been piling into oil contracts, betting that they will gain, thereby offsetting the dollar's decline.
Since the start of the year, crude has shot up nearly 50 percent.
Light, sweet crude for August delivery rose 35 cents to $140.35 a barrel in Asian electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, midday in Singapore.
Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil exporter and OPEC's second-largest exporter.
About 40 percent of world oil exports pass through the Gulf.
African Union leaders huddled in Egypt Monday to address demands they reject the results of Zimbabwe's widely discredited runoff in which President Robert Mugabe was handed a shallow victory.
Mugabe Zimbabwe's only leader since its independence from Britain in 1980 took the oath of office Sunday, hours after election results showed he won Friday's runoff.
However, he was the only candidate in the vote.
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he is closely monitoring developments from Harare, Zimbabwe's capital.
He pulled out of the election, citing political violence and intimidation.
Tsvangirai said he could easily get a non-Zimbabwean passport, "but that will mean I may not be able to come back into the country.
I don't want a situation where I am then treated like a foreigner."
At the summit, Tsvangirai's party has a team of five people, led by the Movement for Democratic Change vice president Thokozani Khupe.
"They are reporting very good progress. They have caucused with a lot of people," Tsvangirai said.
PERTH, Australia (CNN) A man who auctioned his life his house, his car, his job, even his friends on eBay said Monday he is disappointed with the selling price:
Ian Usher, a British immigrant to Australia, put everything he owned as well as introductions to his friends on the online auction site after a painful breakup with his wife prompted him to want a fresh start.
Bidding closed Sunday and reached nearly $384,000 an amount Usher said his house in the western city of Perth was worth on its own.
"I guess I'm a little bit disappointed at the final price, I'd hoped it to be a little higher than that," Usher told Nine Network television on Monday.
"But I am committed to selling and moving on and making a fresh start.
(CNN) A Paris court on Monday ordered Internet auctioneer eBay to pay $63 million in damages to Louis Vuitton for selling fake luxury goods online, according to reports.
The court also barred eBay from selling four perfume brands Christian Dior, Kenzo, Givenchy and Guerlain, AFP reported.
eBay, the world's largest online auctioneer, said it would lodge an appeal and said the decision was not a victory for copyright law.
It is based on LVMH's desire to protect its commercial practices and exclude competition," a spokeswoman for eBay in Paris told AFP.
"This is being done at the expense of the consumers and sellers to whom eBay is always offering opportunities," she added.
LVMH told AFP the decision was a major coup against illegal Internet sales.
The court barred eBay from running ads for the perfume and cosmetic brands or it would face a fine of $79,000 per day.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Monday that a truck carrying 330 crates of bees was traveling on a ramp on the highway when the load shifted and the truck overturned shortly after 1000 GMT.
Police said a downpour of rain has helped to contain the bees in and around the truck.
Bee experts from Agriculture Canada were called in to help deal with the accident.
The driver of the truck was not hurt.
Iraq¡¯s oil minister Monday opened international bidding on six oil fields that could increase the country¡¯s oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day.
But the oil ministry continues to negotiate short-term no-bid contracts with several U.S. and European oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA, Chevron Corp., and BP &#8212; a step recently criticized by two U.S. lawmakers.
Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani announced Monday that 35 international oil companies can bid on long-term contracts for redeveloping the six oil fields, as well as two natural gas fields.
He said the fee-based contracts will not give the winning companies a share in the revenue from oil sales ¡°because this wealth belong to Iraq only and thus we will not allow anyone to share the Iraqis¡¯ oil. ¡±
LOS ANGELES (CNN) &#8212; The Screen Actors Guild has told its 122,000 members to stay on the job even if the union fails to reach a deal with film and television studios before their current contract expires at midnight Monday.
SAG President Alan Rosenberg said no strike vote has been planned, and the union¡¯s negotiators are ¡°coming to the bargaining table every day in good faith.
¡°Any talk about a strike or a management lockout at this point is simply a distraction,¡± he said.
The talks have been complicated by a split between SAG and the smaller American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which has reached its own agreement with the studios.
About 44,000 of AFTRA¡¯s 70,000 members belong to both unions, and SAG leaders have urged those members to vote against the deal.
(CNN) &#8212; A spreading wildfire is forcing the evacuation of a small Arizona town Monday.
Officials in Crown King, a former mining community in the center of the state, are evacuating residents as the fire approaches homes and businesses.
The blaze already has burned 600 acres, and the area¡¯s dry conditions and high winds are helping it spread.
Fire teams will start a controlled fire in an effort to take flames away from the town and create a barrier for homes and other buildings.
Crown King has only about 250 permanent residents, but on weekends there may be close to 1,000 people staying in cabins they own in the area, said Nick Angiolillo, emergency manager for Yavapai County.
More than 10,000 workers plan to spend the next two weeks cleaning up an algal bloom that threatens Olympic sailing events in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao.
The workers already have weeded out 100,000 tons of algae covering parts of the coastal area set aside for the sailing events, state media reported Sunday.
While the algae poses no health threats, it has blocked sailing routes, the news agency Xinhua said.
Sailors from more than 30 countries already are in Qingdao training for the Games, which begin August 8.
The Pakistan Air Force said in a statement that the jet broke the sound barrier as it was shifting from an altitude of 40,000 to 15,000 feet (12,200-4,600 meters).
Earlier, the Air Force had told CNN that it did not have flights in the air at the time.
(CNN) Authorities have restored order in a county in southern China after demonstrators burned a police station and government building, state-run news agencies reported.
Some of about 10,000 demonstrators overturned cars and set fires to protest the police investigation into the death of a teenage girl, according to the state-run China Daily and the privately owned Hong Kong Cable TV, a CNN affiliate.
It was the latest of several public demonstrations in China, and it came just weeks before China hosts the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.
The unrest stemmed from the June 21 death of Li Shu Fan, 15, Hong Kong Cable TV reported.
Police said the girl killed herself, and they released several suspects, according to the station.
The state-run China Daily newspaper attributed the rioters' anger to "officials' alleged attempt to cover up a murder case.
LIMA, Peru (CNN) &#8212; The trial of former President Alberto Fujimori opened here Monday with his former intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, declaring his boss innocent of the charges he faces.
¡°I came here to clarify that Mr. Fujimori has no responsibility with the actions cited in this process,¡± Montesinos told court magistrates.
The trial, held in Ate Vitarte on the outskirts of Lima, marks the first time the two men have been in the same room since they both fled the country eight years ago.
Fujimori, 69, faces charges that range from bribery and corruption to murder and human rights abuses that carry a potential penalty of 30 years in prison.
The remarks will come in Harry Truman¡¯s hometown of Independence, Missouri, just days before the Fourth of July.
¡°Sen. Obama will discuss what patriotism means to him and what it requires of all Americans who love this country and want to see it do better,¡± Obama spokesman Bill Burton wrote in a morning e-mail to reporters.

President Robert Mugabe was sworn in Sunday after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission declared he overwhelmingly won the country's disputed runoff election.
"I, Robert Gabriel Mugabe, do swear that I will well and truly serve Zimbabwe in the office of president, so help me God," Mugabe said at the State House complex in Harare, standing before a red-robed judge wearing a white wig.
The international community has roundly called the election allegedly marred by violence and vote rigging a "sham."
Many voters expressed fear of government retaliation if they did not take part in the vote to extend Mugabe's rule.
Some said they were required to report the serial numbers on their ballots to Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front.
Zimbabwe's Electoral Commission released the final results of Friday's runoff vote, showing that Mugabe won by an almost 9-to-1 margin, with voter turnout about 42 percent.
The final tally, according to the electoral commission, showed Mugabe snaring 2.2 million votes, or about 86 percent of the ballots, to opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai's 233,000.
The commission's quick turnaround was a contrast to the five weeks it took the ZEC to release results from the March 29 election.
Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change quickly denounced the results, calling the election "a one-man race, a one-man circus.
"We have nothing to do with the so-called Mugabe win," MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa "In effect we believe that whatever ZANU-PF and Mugabe are doing is just but a continuation of the sham."
The Bush administration has launched a "significant escalation" of covert operations in Iran, sending U.S. commandos to spy on the country's nuclear facilities and undermine the Islamic republic's government, journalist Seymour Hersh said Sunday.
White House, CIA and State Department officials declined comment on Hersh's report, which appears in this week's issue of The New Yorker.
Hersh told CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer" that Congress has authorized up to $400 million to fund the secret campaign, which involves U.S. special operations troops and Iranian dissidents.
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have rejected findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Iran has halted a clandestine effort to build a nuclear bomb and "do not want to leave Iran in place with a nuclear program," Hersh said.
"They believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year, either Iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program," Hersh said.
The new article, "Preparing the Battlefield," is the latest in a series of articles accusing the Bush administration of preparing for war with Iran.
He based the report on accounts from current and former military, intelligence, and congressional sources.
"As usual with his quarterly pieces, we'll decline to comment," White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told CNN.
"The CIA, as a rule, does not comment on allegations regarding covert operations," CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said.
Microsoft Corp. is scheduled to stop selling its Windows XP operating system to retailers and major computer makers Monday, despite protests from a slice of PC users who don't want to be forced into using XP's successor, Vista.
Once computers loaded with XP have been cleared from the inventory of PC makers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., consumers who can't live without the old operating system on their new machine will have to buy Vista Ultimate or Vista Business and then legally "downgrade" to XP.
Microsoft will still allow smaller mom-and-pop PC builder shops to buy XP for resale through the end of January. A version of XP will also remain available for ultra-low-cost PCs such as the Asus Eee PC.
A group of vocal computer users who rallied around a "Save XP" petition posted on the industry news site InfoWorld had been clamoring for Microsoft to keep selling XP until its next operating system, Windows 7, is available.
The software maker has said it expects to release Windows 7 sometime in 2009.
Spain claimed their first major football title in 44 years after beating Germany 1-0 in Sunday's European Championship final in Vienna.
Fernando Torres scored the only goal of the game, sliding the ball past German keeper Jens Lehmann after 33 minutes as the Spaniards took a grip on the match which they never let slip.
Germany started the second half strongly as they went in search of an equalizer with German captain Michael Ballack firing a shot narrowly wide on 58 minutes.
But Spain had a series of chances to double their lead midway through the half as Sergio Ramos headed straight at Lehmann and Andres Iniesta forced two more saves in quick succession from the German keeper.
Football fans had been gathering all day in the Austrian capital with around 70,000 watching the eagerly anticipated match on giant screens in the Fanzone area in the center of the city in addition to a 50,000 capacity crowd at the Ernst Happel Stadium.
(CNN) The most consistent production unit in Hollywood just hit another home run.
Over the last decade, Pixar has become a byword for quality, combining cutting-edge digital animation with depth of character, slapstick comedy and rich, engrossing storytelling that appeals equally to kids and adults.
"Wall-E" has all of that and more.
Written and directed by Andrew Stanton ("Finding Nemo"), it's Pixar's most ambitious movie and an instant classic.
Wall-E is a solar-powered garbage drone, the last one still operating on an abandoned toxic planet that looks an awful lot like well, is Earth.
A rusty box sitting on caterpillar tracks, with a retractable binocular-shaped head, he compresses junk into building blocks and then piles them up into towers that are shadow-skyscrapers of waste in the ruins of an unidentified city.
Electronic billboards still plug defunct products and bring us up to speed handily:
Having polluted the planet with more waste than it could handle, globo-corporation Buy N Large evacuated its customers on a five-year space cruise ("The final fun-tier," promises the president, played by Fred Willard), leaving the robots to clean up the mess.
It's been 700 years, and Wall-E is still at work.
a whisk, an electric light bulb, bubble wrap.
His most treasured item is a VHS tape of "Hello, Dolly.
His systems are scrambled when he bumps into Eve, a gleaming research pod from the mother ship.
At any rate, Eve is the apple of Wall-E's eye.
"Wall-E" isn't a perfect movie;
a pas de deux in front of the Milky Way (with Wall-E propelled by a fire extinguisher), Eve's maternal glow as she carries out her primary directive, the fleeting moment when first-time space traveler Wall-E turns back, sees the Earth and tries to share his joy in the discovery.
A wonderful combination for any movie. "Wall-E" is easily the best film of the year so far.
But now they face an unwelcome blast of fresh air:
On July 1, the Netherlands will be one of the last European countries to ban smoking in bars and restaurants in compliance with EU law.
The Health Ministry says the ban will apply to cafes that sell marijuana, known as coffee shops. But this being Holland, which for centuries has experimented with social liberalism, there's a loophole:
The ban covers tobacco but not marijuana, which is technically illegal anyway.
But that still leaves coffee shops and their customers in a bind.
Dutch and other European marijuana users traditionally smoke pot in fat, cone-shaped joints mixed with tobacco.
Another is to replace tobacco with herbs like coltsfoot, a common plant that looks like a dandelion and that smokers describe as tasting a bit like oregano.
PARIS, France (CNN) A military shooting demonstration in southeast France on Sunday left 16 people wounded, including children, when real bullets were used instead of blank ones, officials said.
Four of the wounded were in serious condition, including a 3-year-old child, Bernard Lemaire, chief of the regional administration in Aude, said on France-3 television. Fifteen of the injured were civilians.
A Defense Ministry official said the incident occurred during a demonstration of hostage-freeing techniques at the Laperrine military barracks.
The official said investigators will look into why real bullets were used.
The soldier who fired the shots has been detained, Lemaire said. He said the injuries were likely an accident but that it could have been a "criminal act.
In a statement, President Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his "horror" at Sunday's incident at the base, which houses the 3rd marine infantry parachute regiment.
NEW DELHI, India (CNN) One out of every three families living below the poverty level in India paid a bribe last year for basic public services, like admitting a family member into a hospital, according to a new report.
The report by Transparency International India and the Center for Media Studies said poor people in India paid about $210 million (9,000 million rupees) in bribes last year to the police, schools, hospitals and power companies.
"This kind of corruption that denies people their entitlement to basic and need based services, many of which may be 'free' by law, results in the poor finding themselves at the losing end of the corruption chain," said R. H. Tahiliani of Transparency International India in a statement.
Transparency is a non-profit working toward improving ethical practices in government.
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (CNN) Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has denied accusations he sodomized a male aide in a politically explosive scandal, which he blamed on a government conspiracy to thwart his rising clout.
The accusations revived memories of a similar sex scandal a decade ago that led to his imprisonment and ouster as deputy prime minister.
Hours after the aide filed the complaint, Anwar, 60, took refuge at the Turkish Embassy, claiming his life was in danger.
Anwar, 60, dismissed the accusation as "a complete fabrication.
"Certain agents" in the National Front "have initiated plots" to harm him, he said.
He added that he remained committed to work toward a "free and just Malaysia.
Several embassies offered to shelter him but Anwar chose the Turkish mission because of his close ties with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said Badrul Hisham Shaharin, a senior member of Anwar's People's Justice Party. It was not clear how long he would stay there, even though police say they do not intend to arrest him before investigations are complete.
The supermodel who died Saturday afternoon after a fall from her 9th story apartment committed suicide, according to Megan Cuccia, a spokeswoman for the New York medical examiner¡¯s office.
Ruslana Korshunova, 20, was a native of Kazakhstan who was living in New York¡¯s financial district.
The cause of death was blunt impact injuries, according to the medical examiner¡¯s office.
(CNN) &#8212; A wounded dolphin spotted earlier this week in Glasgow, Scotland has been seen again closer to the sea, a marine life group said late Friday, but there were still concerns about the animal.
The dolphin is a Risso¡¯s dolphin, a deep-water species rarely seen so far inshore, the British Divers Marine Life Rescue said.
Experts said they were concerned because the animal appeared thin and had a gash above its left eye.
Friday, BDMLR said it had seen pictures of the same adult dolphin taken a day earlier near Campbelltown, Scotland, near the North Channel which separates Scotland and Northern Ireland and closer to the North Atlantic.
It is not unusual for bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoise to be found in coastal and river regions
A teenager died Saturday after he was decapitated at the Six Flags Over Georgia theme park outside of Atlanta, authorities said.
The youth died after he scaled two 6-foot fences around the Batman roller coaster ride, said a statement issued by park spokeswoman Hela Sheth.
He was struck by the coaster and killed, she said.
¡°We do not know why this person was intent on gaining access to this restricted area,¡± the statement said, noting that multiple signs are posted stating, ¡°Danger Zone,¡± ¡°Do Not Enter¡± and ¡°Authorized Personnel Only.
¡°Some witnesses have stated that the individual was trying to retrieve something he had lost,¡± Sheth said in the statement. ¡°Others reported that he was trying to touch the ride. This is merely speculation at this point, and we are working with park visitors and local police to learn more.
No one on the ride was injured, she said.
WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; Sen. Barack Obama plans to visit Europe and the Middle East this summer, his campaign announced Saturday morning.
The senator from Illinois and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee will visit France, Germany, Israel, Jordan and Britain, his campaign says.
Obama has also said he intends to visit Iraq and Afghanistan this summer, but no announcements regarding that trip were expected to be detailed Saturday.
More than 100 were wounded, the state news agency reported.
Clashes broke out after more than 15,000 protesters headed toward the presidential office, news agency Yonhap said.
The demonstrators used ropes to pull down police buses that had been parked around the presidential office to block the marchers from entering.
Many carried steel pipes and hurled rocks at officers.
Police fired back with water cannons and fire extinguishers.
South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban.
JERUSALEM (CNN) &#8212; The Israeli government Sunday approved a deal with Hezbollah that would involve exchanging prisoners for two kidnapped Israeli soldiers, a government official said.
The Cabinet approved the measure with 22 ministers voting for it and three ministers voting against it, the official said.
Before the vote, Olmert told his Cabinet Sunday that two Israeli soldiers Ehud ¡°Udi¡± Goldwasser and Eldad Regev are not alive, ¡°as far as we know.
Under the deal, Israel will release five Lebanese prisoners, including Samir Kuntar, who has been serving four life sentences in Israel for a 1979 attack in which he killed a four-year-old girl and her father, a government official said.
The deal will also include returning the remains of several slain border infiltrators, the official said.
JERUSALEM (CNN) &#8212; Israel reopened some of its border crossings with Gaza
on Sunday, four days after it closed all but one passage because of Palestinian rocket attacks.
The Sufa and Nahal Oz crossings were open Sunday to allow for the passage of fuel, food and medical supplies.
Last week, Israel closed all but the Erez crossing on Gaza¡¯s northern border on Wednesday in response to rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza &#8212; a violation of the fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas leaders.
A U.S. ship has arrived at a North Korean port carrying 38,000 tons of food aid to be distributed to some of the millions living in hunger, U.N. sources said Sunday.
The delivery is part of a new deal signed by U.S., U.N., and North Korean officials and others, which gives outsiders &#8212; including the U.N. World Food Program &#8212; much greater access to the country.
The deal follows agreement over North Korean nuclear activities.
WASHINGTON (CNN) Hours after sparring with Barack Obama over immigration, John McCain told crowd at fundraiser Saturday night that "Sen. Obama's word cannot be trusted.
"You know, this election is about trust, and trusting people's word, and unfortunately apparently on several items, Sen. Obama's word cannot be trusted," McCain said in Louisville, Kentucky.
The comment came as McCain criticized Obama for reversing positions on public financing and other issues.
Interviews are nothing if not opportunities to drive yourself crazy.
Just remind yourself to look good, appear confident, say all the right things and don't say any of the wrong ones.
It shouldn't be so hard to follow these guidelines except you'll be on the receiving end of an endless line of questions.
Factor in your nerves and you'll be lucky to remember your own name.
If you walk into the interview prepared, you can make sure you know what right things to say, and you can stop yourself from saying the following wrong things.
1. "I hated my last boss.
" Your last boss was a miserable person whose main concern was making your life miserable.
Of course you don't have a lot of nice things to say;
however, don't mistake honesty, which is admirable, for trash-talking, which is despicable.
"If you truly did hate your last boss, I would be prepared to articulate why your last organization and relationship was not right for you," says Greg Moran, director of industry sales and partnerships for Talent Technology Corp. "Then be prepared to explain what type of organization is right for you and what type of management style you best respond to.
2. "I don't know anything about the company.
" Chances are the interviewer will ask what you know about the company.
If you say you don't know anything about it, the interviewer will wonder why you're applying for the job and will probably conclude you're after money, not a career.
"With today's technology," Moran says, "there is no excuse for having no knowledge of a company except laziness and/or poor planning neither of which are attributes [of potential employees] sought by many organizations.
3. "No, I don't have any questions for you."
Much like telling the interviewer that you don't know anything about the company, saying you don't have any questions to ask also signals a lack of interest.
Perhaps the interviewer answered every question or concern you had about the position, but if you're interested in a future with this employer, you can probably think of a few things to ask.
4. "I'm going to need to take these days off."
"We all have lives and commitments and any employer that you would even consider working for understands this.
If you progress to an offer stage, this is the time for a discussion regarding personal obligations," Moran suggests.
"Just don't bring it up prior to the salary negotiation/offer stage.
5. "How long until I get a promotion?"
While you want to show that you're goal-oriented, be certain you don't come off as entitled or ready to leave behind a job you don't even have yet.
6. "Are you an active member in your church?"
As you attempt to make small talk with an interviewer, don't cross the line into inappropriate chitchat.
LONDON, England (CNN) China's new found wealth has seen an explosion in the number of new developments springing up in what is, arguably, the world's biggest building boom.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in Beijing, which has transformed into a virtual construction zone as the city undergoes an Olympic makeover.
Once a flat cityscape in the shadow of the formidable Forbidden City, Beijing has been struck by skyscraper fever.
Standing on the edge of the former site of the city's historic walls are a series of eight asymmetrical towers that bestride the smog-laden landscape like a colossus.
Dubbed the Beijing Linked Hybrid, this architectural maverick has certainly pushed the design envelope to its very limit.
The brainchild of New York architect Steven Holl, the mixed-use unit is a ring of eight 21-story towers, linked at the 20th floor by gently sloping public sky bridges, lined with galleries, cafes , restaurants, bars and shops.
It also has green roofs, filters to protect residents from pollution and large ponds to harvest recycled rainwater.
Among them is that its brand of green luxury won't come cheap.
With apartments selling for 44,000 Yuan, or $6,000, per square meter, it can only appeal to China's nouveaux riches, further creating social division in what is already a deprived area of the city.
EASTER ISLAND, Chile (CNN) It's earth's most remote inhabited land, a South Pacific speck of volcanic rock so isolated the locals call it "Te Pito O Te Henua," or "The Navel of the World.
But Easter Island is a bellybutton experiencing a tourist boom and some are worried the onslaught of outsiders could take a toll on the very things they come to see, the gigantic stone heads known as Moais.
"More tourism, more deterioration.
"We are at the point now where, either we protect what we have or we lose it," she said.
Moais (pronounced Moe-Eyes) already face a host of natural enemies.
Sun, surf, winds and humidity are eating at their features.
Erosion tears away the Ahus, ceremonial platforms of dirt and stone on which they sit, and even is slowly claiming the island's porous edges.

The Bush administration hailed North Korea's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia.
As a result of Pyongyang's handover of the 60-page declaration document and Friday's expected destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon President Bush ordered some sanctions against North Korea lifted and instructed the State Department to remove the reclusive communist nation from U.S. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism.
But as important as what the document says is what it doesn't say.
There is no mention of how many weapons North Korea has or where they are hidden.
Nor did North Korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with Syria.
Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check North Korea's claims. And North Korea has promised to allow U.S. inspectors access to the Yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts.
PYONGYANG, North Korea (CNN) A day after releasing details of its long-secret nuclear program, North Korea on Friday destroyed a highly visible tower at a facility where officials now acknowledge they extracted plutonium to build nuclear weapons, according to reports.
The massive implosion at the Yongbyon facility was intended to be a powerful public symbol of a move to end nuclear activities by the Communist nation once branded a member of an "axis of evil" by U.S. President George W. Bush.
But the move will also have a practical purpose.
Nuclear experts say that the plant's destroyed central water-cooling tower would take a year or longer to rebuild if North Korea were to try using the plant again.
"This is a critical piece of equipment for the nuclear reactor," said analyst John Wolfsthal, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has been following North Korea since the 1980s.
"Without this facility, the reactor can't operate and can't produce more plutonium for weapons. "
DETROIT, Michigan (CNN) Chrysler LLC said Thursday that people who buy its vehicles next year will have the option of turning their cars and trucks into wireless Internet hotspots.
The company said the feature will be available as part of its "uconnect" system that will debut in most 2009 Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep models.
The wireless Internet will come as a dealer-installed option and will work over cellular telephone links.
Spokesman Todd Goyer said people will be able to use laptop computers in their cars and trucks just as if they were in an office or home.
To access the Internet, vehicles will need to have "uconnect" hardware, which Chrysler will unveil to compete with Ford's "Sync" and other in-car electronic systems.
NEW YORK (CNN) As Paris Hilton's sidekick on "The Simple Life," Nicole Richie showed a flair for comedy and an impish glee at cracking jokes at others' expense.
The 26-year-old celebutante will again display a caustic streak in an upcoming guest spot on NBC's "Chuck," portraying the mean-spirited high school nemesis of undercover CIA agent Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski).
In the episode, which will air this fall, Sarah must confront Richie's character when she is forced to attend her 10-year high school reunion for a mission with fellow agent Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) as her date.
"Nicole auditioned for the part and was very funny," executive producer Josh Schwartz said in a statement Wednesday.
"This role is a great opportunity for her to show off her comedic skills and be diabolically evil and kick some butt. It's going to be really fun.
The Phoenix lander's first taste test of soil near Mars' north pole reveals a briny environment similar to what can be found in backyards on Earth, scientists said Thursday.
Phoenix landed a month ago to study the habitability of Mars' northern latitudes.
Phoenix so far has not detected organic carbon considered an essential building block of life.
Last week, the lander found evidence of ice below the soil.
Scientists generally agree that liquid water, a stable energy source and organic, or carbon-containing, compounds are required for a habitable zone.
The latest experiment was designed to test for minerals that do not have carbon in them.
Earlier this week, Phoenix's 8-foot-long robotic arm delivered a pinch of dirt dug up from near the surface to its onboard lab.
Like a chemist, the spacecraft mixed the soil with water brought from Earth into a beaker the size of a teacup and stirred it.
Sensors inside the beaker detect the soil's pH and probe for traces of the nutrients.
Preliminary results showed the soil had a pH between 8 and 9, researchers said.
A pH less than 7 means the solution is acidic, while a pH over 7 means it is alkaline.
Phoenix also detected the presence of magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride in the mixture.
"It's very typical of the soil here on Earth minus the organics," Kounaves said during a teleconference from Tucson, Arizona.
New York Yankees outfielder Hideki Matsui remained out of the lineup and the batting cage with a sore left knee Thursday and will be re-examined Friday by team doctors.
If he is cleared to play, Matsui could be the designated hitter for the first of the Yankees' two games Friday against the Mets.
If the doctors don't like what they see, Matsui might be headed to the disabled list.
"You don't want it to come to that, but if we feel it's in the best interests of him and the ballclub, that's something we'll talk about.
Matsui had right knee surgery during the offseason, but it's his left knee that is hurting.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) &#8212; For the first time in three decades, Argentina will not meet its goal of beef exports to the European Union this year.
stems from a bitter dispute between the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and farmers, who oppose a tax increase she levied in March on the export of grains.
Fernandez described her move as an attempt to redistribute wealth to other sectors of society so that farmers would not be the only ones to benefit from soaring prices for grains on world markets.
In response, irate farmers erected roadblocks that paralyzed much of the country¡¯s transport of goods.
That sparked the ire of truck drivers, who conducted similar demonstrations, further hamstringing traffic, which blocked delivery of food to supermarkets resulting in spot food shortages.
Refrigerator trucks, used to transport meat from the slaughterhouse, didn¡¯t make it to the ports.
NEW YORK (CNN) &#8212; A three-year initiative will seek to give HIV tests to everyone in the Bronx from age 18 to 64, the New York City Department of Health announced Thursday.
The announcement comes on the heels of a report released Wednesday that found a high rate of ¡°unsafe sexual behavior¡± in the city.
The Bronx has been particularly hard-hit, according to the report.
A quarter of New Yorkers infected with HIV &#8212; more than 21,000 people &#8212;
live in the Bronx, and the borough reports a third of the city¡¯s AIDS deaths each year.

(CNN) &#8212; Romanian authorities plan to decide Friday whether to allow an 11-year-old girl to have an abortion after she was raped by her teenage uncle, the Romanian Ministry of Health said Thursday.The girl is now 20 weeks pregnant &#8212;
too far along to have an abortion in Romania &#8212;
and her parents have said they¡¯ll take her to Britain for an abortion if the Romanian authorities deny her one at home, a spokeswoman at the health ministry said.
It is illegal to have an abortion in Romania after 14 weeks unless the pregnancy poses problems for the mother¡¯s health, said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named.
Abortions are legal in Britain up to 24 weeks.
¡°If the mother wants to go to the UK (with her pregnant daughter), it¡¯s up to her,¡± said the spokeswoman.
The uncle has subsequently gone missing, the ministry said.
NEW YORK (CNN) &#8212; Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc., the largest U.S. brewer, will take the ¡°energy¡± out of its alcoholic energy drinks as part of a nationwide legal settlement, it announced Thursday.
An investigation by attorneys general of 11 states found that the brewer was marketing its caffeinated alcoholic beverages to minors and misrepresenting the drinks¡¯ health benefits, said New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.
such as guarana and ginseng &#8212; from the drinks, making them simply alcoholic beverages instead of alcoholic energy beverages, the company and the attorneys general said.
The move takes the company out of the alcoholic energy drink field, and part of the agreement with the attorneys general is that will never again produce, distribute or market any alcoholic drinks containing caffeine or other stimulants.
(CNN) &#8212; The group that coordinates Internet domain addresses has voted to open domain name extensions up to a vast new array of possibilities.
At a meeting in Paris on Thursday, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) unanimously agreed to a policy that will eventually allow a host of new ¡°generic top-level domains¡± to join the list of 20 domains that now includes dot-com, dot-edu and dot-org, as well as country extensions such as dot-jp or dot-it.
Analysts say the new list could lead to a host of new business-, city- or hobby-specific domain names, such as dot-hotel, dot-flight, dot-fishing or even dot-sex.
ICANN also voted to break the English-language prominence of domain names by allowing ¡°internationalized¡± names &#8212;
ones using other languages¡¯ characters, such as Chinese or Arabic.
WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a sweeping handgun ban in the nation¡¯s capital, saying it violates Americans¡¯ constitutional right to ¡°keep and bear arms.
The gun control issue has been politically divisive for years, and the monumental decision is expected to have broad social and legal implications, especially in an election year.
The majority of justices disagreed with arguments that the District of Columbia government has broad authority to enact what local officials called ¡°reasonable¡± weapons restrictions in order to reduce violent crime.
It sounds like the setup to a joke: A crocodile walks into a bar ¡¦
Drinkers at a watering hole in the Australian outback found themselves toasting a baby saltwater crocodile that wandered up to the pub¡¯s door Sunday.
No one knows how the two-foot long (60 cm) crocodile ended up outside the Noonamah Tavern, located off a dusty highway about 25 miles (40 km) from the Northern Territory capital of Darwin.
But unusual creatures are all in a day¡¯s drinking for the tavern, said bartender Leila Naray.
A couple of men brought the crocodile inside the pub, taped its mouth and Naray snapped photos.
Authorities in southern China are using information obtained from mistresses of government officials to crack down on corruption, state media reported Thursday.
At least 80 percent of government officials arrested for corruption in the city of Dongguan in Guangdong province were exposed thanks to their mistresses, the China Daily said.
Beijing has been trying to rein in corruption for several years.
A law that went into effect last year mandates that government officials found to have mistresses be dismissed from their posts.
In recent years, the country has seen several highly-publicized corruption cases involving officials who steal &#8212;
The endorsement is expected to help rally support around the presumptive Democratic nominee in the critical swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, where union voters make up between 25 and 35 percent of the total vote.
North Korea on Thursday is expected to release details on its plutonium stockpile and continue preparations to publicly dismantle a controversial nuclear reactor &#8212;
key steps meant to assuage international concerns about nuclear activity in the usually secretive Communist nation.
Under an agreement hammered out in six-nation talks that included the United States and China, leaders in Pyonyang agreed to provide a full accounting of the plutonium, ¡°acknowledge¡± concerns about its nuclear proliferation and uranium enrichment activities and agree to continued cooperation with a process to ensure that no further activities are taking place.
They are expected to hand over a ¡°declaration¡± on the plutonium activities to Chinese officials around midday local time (overnight ET) Thursday.
The Chinese would then turn the papers over to the U.S. State Department, which is expected to announce that North Korea has been removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.
Before he was let go as Mariners general manager, Bill Bavasi was telling his bosses that the team's problem was the players, not manager John McLaren.
First they fired Bavasi himself. Then they axed McLaren.
But now, with the team buried 19.5 games out in the AL West, the Mariners are finally looking to shake up the roster.
Technically, that would even include the organization's crown jewel, Ichiro.
But if the Mariners really want to shake things up, they should seriously consider trading Ichiro, the international icon who has three tools that are among the best in baseball:
His negatives are that he appears at times to be playing at half speed and to have more interest in stylin' than anything of substance.
Ichiro isn't the only star on the roster that would draw serious interest in trade discussions.
LOS ANGELES (CNN) Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's love for children is by no means limited to their own:
The couple has donated $1 million to help kids affected by the war in Iraq, the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict announced Wednesday.

"We hope to encourage others to give to these great organizations," Pitt added in the statement.
WASHINGTON (CNN) Scientists unearthed a skull of the most primitive four-legged creature in Earth's history, which should help them better understand the evolution of fish to advanced animals that walk on land.
365 million-year-old fossil skull, shoulders and part of the pelvis of the water-dweller Ventastega curonica were found in Latvia, researchers report in a study published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
Even though Ventastega is probably an evolutionary dead-end, the finding brings new details on the evolutionary transition from fish to tetrapods.
Tetrapods are animals with four limbs and include such descendants as amphibians, birds and mammals.
Although an earlier discovery found a slightly older animal that was more fish than tetrapod, Ventastega is more tetrapod than fish.
It probably had stubby limbs with an unknown number of digits, scientists said.
"If you saw it from a distance, it would look like a small alligator, but if you look closer, you would find a fin in the back," said lead author Per Ahlberg, a professor of evolutionary biology at Uppsala University in Sweden.
"I imagine this is an animal that could haul itself over sand banks without any difficulty. Maybe it's poking around in semi-tidal creeks, picking up fish that got stranded.
TOKYO, Japan (CNN) Japanese police on Tuesday arrested a 77-year-old man suspected of killing his entire family with a hammer, including a 4-year-old granddaughter, a police official said.
Police discovered the bodies after receiving a phone call from a man who reported killing his family, the official said.
They rushed to the suspect's house in Kashiwa, east of Tokyo, and found the suspect, Yoshio Kiuchi, slumped on the floor and splattered with blood, the official said on condition of anonymity, citing department policy.
They also found the bodies of Kiuchi's 4-year-old granddaughter, 75-year-old wife, 49-year-old son and 44-year-old daughter-in-law, he said.
"A man made an emergency call to police this morning, saying he killed his entire family ," the official said.
(CNN) The group controlling Internet domain names may soon decide whether to relax naming rules and potentially open up a virtual domain name gold rush.
On Thursday, the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) will vote on two key proposals.
The first would allow domains that do not use Latin characters, meaning domain names using Chinese, Arabic or Cyrillic letters.
The other proposal would allow domains to use nearly any letter or number combination up to 64 characters.
If ICANN approves the proposals, the world of .com and .org and country names like .jp or .fr would be opened to a much wider choice, such as .hotel or .sex.
Just the thought of .sex has bloggers predicting an auction frenzy, as almost any word in any language could become a domain name extension.
ICANN has previously turned down requests for .xxx, which would be used by adult sites, over fear of seeming to give approval of pornography sites.
Analysts say .xxx and nearly everything else would be possible if the rules are relaxed.
Among the exceptions would be trademarked domains, such as .cnn or
.microsoft not being on general sale.
LONDON, England (CNN) A water lily painting by impressionist master Claude Monet was sold for more than $80 million at auction Tuesday, kicking off a week of modern-art sales expected to reach records that defy the global economic downturn.

CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) &#8212; Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama says he disagrees with a Supreme Court decision striking down the death penalty for child rapists, telling reporters Wednesday that states should be able to execute people for ¡°heinous¡± crimes.
¡°I think that the rape of small child, 6 or 8 years old, is a heinous crime,¡± the Illinois senator said.
¡°And if a state makes a decision that under narrow, limited, well-defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable, that does not violate our Constitution.
The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that capital punishment can be applied only to murderers, striking down a death sentence for a Louisiana man convicted of sexually assaulting his 8-year-old stepdaughter.
John Smoltz is keeping his right arm numb and his hopes for a comeback warm.
Smoltz, who had season-ending shoulder surgery on June 10, spoke Tuesday while wearing a compression sleeve that keeps his arm a frigid 32 degrees.
He's happy with the high-tech device which he said allowed him to sleep for five hours - his longest yet - on Monday night while cutting back on pain medication.
Smoltz said he's not yet able to watch games from the dugout because he's worried about having to make a sudden move and hit the arm.
He hopes to be out of the sling, and back in the dugout, by the All-Star game.
Smoltz hopes to know more about his hopes for a comeback during the next few months.
His doctors have said he can begin throwing within four months.
Smoltz was 3-2 with a 2.57 ERA in six games despite pitching through pain.
Smoltz, 41, is the only pitcher in baseball history with 200 wins and 150 saves.
He holds major league records with 15 victories and 194 strikeouts in the postseason and won the 1996 Cy Young Award.
Sen. Barack Obama has asked top contributors to help his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton, retire her debt, an Obama campaign source said Tuesday.
Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination this month.
She has amassed a campaign debt of about $22 million, but about $12 million of that is money the New York senator loaned to the campaign herself.

Clinton and Obama have scheduled a joint campaign appearance Friday in Unity, New Hampshire.
Obama said Tuesday that he had spoken with Clinton by phone earlier in the day as well as on Sunday.
"We had a good conversation," he said. "We're looking forward to seeing each other tomorrow and campaigning on Friday.
Toyota may scale back its ambitious target of selling more vehicles in the United States this year than it did in 2007, as damage from an economic slowdown and soaring oil prices becomes more fully known.
Surpassing the 2.62 million vehicles the company sold last year in the U.S. - its biggest market - would be difficult, Executive Vice President Tokuichi Uranishi told a shareholders meeting Tuesday, according to Toyota spokesman Paul Nolasco.
The world's No. 2 automaker announced in December that it was hoping to sell 2.64 million vehicles in the U.S. in 2008 and predicted a 5% jump in global sales to 9.85 million vehicles because of strong sales in emerging markets such as China and Russia.
in July, as it does every year.
Through the first half of June, total auto sales in the U.S. were running at an annualized rate of about 12.5 million vehicles, according to J.D. Power & Associates.
It was the lowest level for June in decades and a huge drop from the year-earlier rate of 16.3 million vehicles.
Uranishi projected that total U.S. auto sales could slip under 15 million vehicles this year, Nolasco said.
Last week, Ford Motor Co. (F, Fortune 500) said industrywide sales could drop as low as 14.4 million for the year, which would be the lowest level in 13 years, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai called Wednesday for armed international peacekeepers to secure a new presidential election in the country where violence has marred a runoff set for this week.
Tsvangirai won the most votes in the March 29 election but failed to gain a majority.
He formally withdrew Tuesday from the runoff against President Robert Mugabe, who said Friday's vote would take place as planned.
"We do not want armed conflict, but the people of Zimbabwe need the words of indignation from global leaders to be backed by the moral rectitude of military force," Tsvangirai wrote in Wednesday's edition of the British newspaper The Guardian.
They would separate the people from their oppressors and cast the protective shield around the democratic process for which Zimbabwe yearns.
The U.N. Security Council unanimously condemned the Zimbabwean government Monday for its campaign of violence and intimidation but stopped short of calling for a postponement of the runoff or for a new election. Tsvangirai, however, was clear.
"The reality is that a new election, devoid of violence and intimidation, is the only way to put Zimbabwe right.
Meanwhile, Mugabe said Tuesday that the runoff will happen as planned. "We will proceed with our election;
We are a sovereign state, and that is it. "They can shout as loud as they like from Washington or from London or from any other quarter. Our people, only our people, will decide, and no one else.
VANCOUVER, British Columbia (CNN) A new case of mad cow disease was confirmed in Canada, its 13th case since 2003.
There was no risk to public health because no part of the animal entered the human food systems, government inspectors said.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Monday that the latest case of mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, does not suggest the problem is more widespread.
Mad cow disease causes spongy holes in the brain.
In people, a rare but fatal form of the disease called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been linked to eating infected tissue from cows.
"We're very confident that BSE is not common in Canada because of our surveillance," said George Luterbach, a veterinarian with the agency.
It is the third case in British Columbia in the last three years.
ASUNCION, Paraguay (CNN) &#8212; Paraguay¡¯s Senate failed to muster a quorum Tuesday, thereby frustrating President Nicanor Duarte Frutos¡¯s bid to resign two months before the end of his term to join that same legislative body.
An insufficient number of members of liberals, minority party members and even some members of his ruling Colorado Party showed up in the Senate to form the quorum necessary to approve the resignation request he made on Monday.
That means Duarte must continue as president of the republic until Congress decides to accept his resignation or until August 15, when his term of office officially ends.

JERUSALEM (CNN) &#8212; An Israeli soldier committed suicide at Tel Aviv¡¯s airport during a departure ceremony for French President Nicolas Sarkozy, prompting security guards to whisk Sarkozy and his wife into their plane.
The sound of the gunshot sparked an immediate security alert.
Video showed Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, shaking hands with officials at the base of the stairs leading up to the plane when Israeli security guards interrupted them.
The Sarkozys quickly walked up the stairs into the aircraft while the guards surrounded Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and moved him and other Israeli officials into a waiting car.
JERUSALEM (CNN) &#8212; Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will ask his Cabinet on Sunday to approve a deal with Hezbollah that would involve exchanging prisoners for two kidnapped Israeli soldiers.
Olmert told Karnit Goldwasser, the wife of one of the kidnapped soldiers, about the development, she said.
Hezbollah militants kidnapped Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev and killed three other Israeli soldiers in a July 2006 raid into northern Israel.
Israeli troops invaded Lebanon in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the soldiers.
Israel¡¯s chief military rabbi began a procedure on Monday to determine if the two soldiers are dead or alive.
¡°I look forward to being back with this great team,¡± she said as she returned to the Senate at the end of a two-week vacation, taken after she conceded the 17-month-long primary contest to Sen. Barack Obama.
The second-term New York Democrat pledged to ¡°immerse myself in there,¡± pointing to the chamber.
She had just emerged from the party¡¯s weekly luncheon that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called ¡°one of the most emotional caucuses¡± he¡¯s ever attended on Capitol Hill.
He said the New York senator entered the event to a sea of high fives, cheers, and a standing ovation from her Democratic colleagues.
(CNN) &#8212; Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday blasted Sen. John McCain¡¯s energy plans as ¡°gimmicks,¡± saying his policies ¡°will only increase our oil addiction for another four years.
¡°For decades, John McCain has been a part of this failure in Washington.
He commended McCain for speaking out on climate change but said that ¡°time and time again, he has opposed investing in the alternative sources of energy that have helped fuel some of the very same projects and businesses that he¡¯s now highlighting in this campaign. ¡±
Sen. John McCain on Tuesday said energy efficiency ¡°should begin at home¡± and proposed that the federal government purchase more environmentally friendly vehicles.
¡°Every year the federal government buys upwards of 60,000 cars and other vehicles, not including military or law-enforcement vehicles,¡± McCain said, according to an advance copy of his remarks.
¡°From now on, we¡¯re going to make those civilian vehicles flex-fuel capable, plug-in hybrid or cars fueled by clean natural gas. If our great goal is to move American transportation toward lower carbon emissions, then it should start with the federal fleet. ¡±
Curt Schilling could be throwing off a mound by January after having shoulder surgery Monday that keeps him on target to pitch by the middle of next season if he decides to return.
Schilling, who hasn't pitched this season, decided last week to have the operation after the rehabilitation the team preferred didn't relieve the pain he felt when throwing from a mound at far below maximum effort.
The 41-year-old right-hander and postseason star knew it would end his season and possibly his career.
Chances of pitching again seem more likely after the operation.
His 11-2 postseason record is the best of any pitcher with 10 or more victories and he has a 2.23 postseason ERA in 19 starts.
Gere, a Buddhist who has been active in the movement to free Tibet, appears in the TV ad for Fiat's new Lancia Delta, using the car to whiz from Hollywood to the snows of the Himalayas, where he plays with a group of young Buddhist monks.
Fiat said in a statement Friday that casting Gere for the ad had not been a "political choice" and was not driven by the desire to "interfere with the internal political system of any country.
The company apologized to China's government and its people for any offense arising from "misinterpretations of its well-established position of neutrality.
However, a Fiat spokesman said the company would continue to run the ad in Italy and would introduce it in other European countries as the Lancia Delta goes on sale across the continent.
The spokesman, who could not be identified under company policy, said the ad was not being aired in China, where the car is not on sale.
Gere has been vilified in China for criticizing Beijing's human rights records and policies toward Tibet, which Chinese communist troops occupied in 1951.
He is also a close supporter and student of the region's exiled Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, who Beijing says is a separatist.
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously condemned the Zimbabwean government because of violence that has marred the campaign leading up to a scheduled presidential election runoff, which forced the withdrawal of the opposition candidate from the race.
The council's statement issued late Monday questioned the legitimacy of any election held under such circumstances but did not directly call for the runoff, scheduled for Friday, to be postponed.
Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made that appeal, saying the vote runoff as currently scheduled "would only deepen divisions within the country and produce a result that could not be seen as credible.
But Boniface Chidyausiku, Zimbabwe's ambassador to the United Nations, said after the Security Council vote that the runoff would take place as planned.
"The Security Council cannot micromanage political elections in any country," he said. "They have expressed their view, and we take note of their view.
But as far as we're concerned, the date is set.
Opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, who announced Sunday that he was dropping out of the runoff, took refuge Monday in the Dutch Embassy in Harare.
He cited an ongoing campaign of political intimidation, harassment and arrests by President Robert Mugabe's government and the ruling Zanu-PF party.
Mugabe spokesman George Charamba said Monday that "there is nothing on this good Earth that will stop the elections on the 27th.
Chidyausiku said the "violence is not widespread.
"The problem is the secretary general and other members of the (Security) Council are basing their arguments on sensationalist reports that are coming from Zimbabwe," he said. "When I talk to people at home, and what you see in the international media, you would think you are talking about two different countries.
TOKYO (CNN) Japanese police arrested a 19-year-old man Monday for allegedly threatening on the Internet to go on a stabbing spree at Tokyo Disneyland.
Authorities were also searching for a woman suspected of wounding three people in a knifing incident Sunday.
Since the deadly stabbing attack in early June, police have arrested several people for allegedly using the Internet to make chillingly specific threats of violence.
"I will go to Disneyland to stab visitors to death," the 19-year-old wrote, according to a police official in Chiba, the suburban area where the amusement park is located.
The suspect's name was not released because he is below the age of 20 a minor under Japanese law.
Investigators have found no evidence that he was preparing to carry out a real assault, the official said on condition of anonymity, citing department policy.
The arrest on Monday coincided with a search for a woman suspected of stabbing three people in the arm at a crowded train station in the western city of Osaka.
(CNN) Colombia's main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has released a video of an abducted congressman as proof the politician is alive.
The video, broadcast Saturday on Colombian TV Caracol, showed Sigifredo Lopez, who was kidnapped in 2002 with 11 other politicians in the city of Santiago de Cali.
In the footage, Lopez cites the date as March 30, 2008, and confirms that other members of his party died in captivity on June 18, 2007.
Lopez asked the government of President Alvaro Uribe, who has been intransigent in negotiating with the guerrillas, to reach a deal quickly with the rebels and exchange prisoners for Colombian hostages in a safe haven.
Lopez added that he suffers from migraine headaches, stress, insomnia, depression and hypertension.
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) &#8212; Comedian-actor George Carlin, know for his raunchy, but insightful humor, died of heart failure Sunday in Santa Monica, California, his publicist said.
He was 71.
Carlin, who had a history of heart problems, went into the hospital Sunday afternoon after complaining of heart trouble, said publicist Jeff Abraham. He died at 5:55 p.m. (8: 55 p.m. ET) at St. John¡¯s Hospital.
Carlin was best known for his routine ¡°Seven Words You Can Never Say On Television,¡± which appeared in 1972¡¯s ¡°Class Clown¡± album.
The comedy sketch prompted a landmark indecency case after WBAI-FM radio in New York aired it in 1973.
The Federal Communications Commission ruled the material ¡°indecent.
The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court where the justices ruled in 1978 on a 5-to-4 vote that the sketch was ¡°indecent but not obscene,¡± giving the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency on the airwaves, especially when it involves children.
¡°So my name is a footnote in American legal history, which I¡¯m perversely kind of proud of,¡± Carlin said. ¡°In the context of that era, it was daring. ¡±
LONDON, England (CNN) Nelson Mandela is in London for a week of events to celebrate his 90th birthday.
The former South African president's plane landed at Heathrow Airport Monday morning.
He is due to attend an outdoor concert in his honor in Hyde Park on Friday.
Performers include Queen, Annie Lennox, Leona Lewis and the Soweto Gospel Choir.
Troubled diva Amy Winehouse is also scheduled to sing, if her doctors allow it.
She was taken to a hospital last week after fainting at home.
Proceeds from the concert will go to the 46664 charity, the AIDS charity named for the number Mandela wore while imprisoned by South Africa's apartheid authorities.
Mandela also is due to meet prominent supporters, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown, former U.S. President Bill Clinton and talk show host Oprah Winfrey.
Mandela, who turns 90 on July 18, has visited London many times, and has expressed gratitude to the city for the constant vigil that was held outside the South African Embassy during the apartheid years.
Friday's concert coincides with the 20th anniversary of London's Free Mandela concert, held to demand he be freed from prison.

WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; The airline industry on Monday blasted a proposal from the Department of Homeland Security to require air carriers to collect the fingerprints of foreign air travelers departing the United States.
In comments to DHS, the Air Transport Association said the proposed rule is ¡°unjustifiable¡± and ¡°should be terminated.
¡± The ATA, the trade organization of the U.S. airline industry, said fingerprinting is a border control responsibility of DHS.
The airlines objected to paying for the cost of carrying out the proposal, an estimated $3.5 billion over 10 years.
KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) &#8212; U.S.-led coalition forces said Monday they killed 55 militants in response to an ambush in eastern Afghanistan.
Coalition troops launched ground and air attacks in response, killing 55 militants and wounding 25. They also detained three others, the statement said.
In the second incident, a coalition attack on militants planting a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan killed two civilians, including a child, an Afghan official said Monday.
A coalition spokesman confirmed the Sunday night attack on the insurgents but said he did not know of any civilian casualties.
BRISBANE, Australia (CNN) Police say they have charged a man found asleep in a motorized wheelchair on a highway in northern Australia with drunk driving.
The officers breath-tested the 64-year-old man, who registered a blood alcohol reading of 0.301 more than six times the legal driving limit and charged him with operating a vehicle while drunk.
The man, whose name was not released, told police he was making a 14km (nine miles) from his home to a friend's place, Waters said.
BEIJING, China (CNN) China is planning a major cleanup operation for Mount Everest next year and may limit the number of climbers and other visitors, Tibet's environmental protection chief was quoted as saying Monday.
The cleanup and new measures are planned for the second half of 2009, Zhang Yongze told the official Xinhua News Agency.
China has already enacted some restrictions, including forbidding vehicles from driving directly to the base camp at 16,995 feet (5,180 meters), Zhang said.
MINEOLA, Texas (CNN) In the windowless front rooms of a former day care center in a tiny Texas community, children as young as 5 were fed powerful painkillers they knew as "silly pills" and forced to perform sex shows for a crowd of adults.
Two people have already been convicted in the case.
Now a third person with ties to the club, previously known in town only as a swingers group, is set to go on trial Monday not far from Mineola, population 5,100.
Patrick Kelly, 41, is charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child, tampering with physical evidence and engaging in organized criminal activity.
In all, six adults have been charged in connection with the case, including a parent of the three siblings involved.
Jurors this year deliberated less than five minutes before returning guilty verdicts against the first two defendants, who were accused of grooming the kids for sex shows in "kindergarten" classes and passing off Vicodin as "silly pills" to help the children perform.
Jamie Pittman and
Shauntel Mayo were sentenced to life in prison.
Kelly also faces a life sentence if convicted, and Smith County prosecutors hope for another swift verdict.
ASUNCION, Paraguay (CNN) &#8212; Paraguay¡¯s President Nicanor Duarte offered Congress his resignation Monday, two months before his term is slated to end.
Duarte, a member of the ruling Colorado Party who was barred from running for a second five-year presidential term in last April¡¯s elections, instead ran for and won a seat in Paraguay¡¯s Senate.

WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; President Bush has nominated Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody to serve as head of the Army¡¯s supply arm, a promotion that would make her America¡¯s first female four-star general, the Pentagon announced Monday.
The nomination would make Dunwoody, appointed the deputy commanding general and chief of staff of the Army Materiel Command last week, to the top spot at the command. The Senate must confirm her promotion.
¡°This is an historic occasion for the Department of Defense, and I am proud to nominate Lt. Gen. Ann Dunwoody for a fourth star,¡± said Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
¡°Her 33 years of service, highlighted by extraordinary leadership and devotion to duty, make her exceptionally qualified for this senior position.
Dunwoody, a native of New York, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1975 after her graduation from the State University of New York in Cortland.
She holds graduate degrees in national resource strategy and logistics management, and became the Army¡¯s top-ranking woman in 2005.
WASHINGTON (CNN) North Korea is to blow up a key part of its controversial Yongbyon nuclear reactor on Friday.
The destruction of the plant's cooling tower is part of an agreement with the United States aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula in exchange for loosening some restrictions on the highly secretive Communist country.
The North Korean government has invited news organizations, including CNN, to witness the event.
Earlier this year, Pyongyang agreed to disable its nuclear reactor and provide a full accounting of its plutonium stockpile, "acknowledge" concerns about its proliferation activities and its uranium enrichment activity, and agree to continue cooperation with a verification process to ensure no further activities are taking place.
North Korea has been taking Yongbyon's main reactor apart, but
imploding the cooling tower is an exceptionally important psychological step given that the highly recognizable shape of the structure is synonymous with nuclear power plants.
The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, says it would take a year to rebuild if North Korea decided to go back on its agreement, and that the construction could not be done in secret.
(CNN) &#8212; Rescuers have found at least 34 survivors and at least 11 dead from a ferry that capsized in a typhoon, the Philippine Information Agency said Monday.
A total of 864 people were on board the Princess of the Stars &#8211; including 725 passengers, according to the ship¡¯s owner, Sulpicio Lines.
A Red Cross official said victims and survivors from other fishing boats that capsized in the area have been found as well.
Oil and energy are expected to be on the agenda as McCain campaigns in California and Sen. Barack Obama speaks in New Mexico on Monday.
McCain, during a town hall-style meeting at Fresno State University, is expected to propose a $300 million prize for whoever can develop an automobile battery that ¡°has the size, capacity, cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug-in hybrids or electric cars.
Spain beat world champions Italy 4-2 on penalties to reach the semifinals of Euro 2008 after Sunday's match in Vienna had ended scoreless.
Spanish captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas saved penalties by Daniele de Rossi and Antonio Di Natale to leave Cesc Fabregas to beat Gianluigi Buffon with the deciding kick.
David Villa, Santi Cazorla, Marcos Senna also scored for Spain, but Dani Guiza had his effort saved by Buffon.
Fabio Grosso and Mauro Camoranesi scored their penalties for Italy who won a shoot out to beat France in the final of the 2006 World Cup.
"Clearly losing on penalties after working so hard doesn't leave us happy," Italy coach Roberto Donadoni told the Associated Press. "We all spent a lot of energy.
They've got to be the most disappointed, and I'm sorry for them.
Spain will return to the Ernst Happel stadium on Thursday to play Russia for a place in the final of the tournament.
Germany play Turkey in the first semifinal in Basle the previous night.
"I would like to congratulate first of all my players for their remarkable behavior and maintaining their morale during the match," said 69-year-old Spanish coach Luis Aragones after the penalty drama.
"It was very difficult because the Italians closed down all the spaces, which made it difficult to play our natural game.
Sen. Barack Obama on Sunday said as president he would strengthen government oversight of energy traders he blames in large part for the skyrocketing price of oil.
The Democratic candidate's campaign singled out the so-called "Enron loophole" for allowing speculators to run up the cost of fuel by operating outside federal regulation.
Oil closed near $135 a barrel on Friday almost double the price a year ago.
"My plan fully closes the Enron loophole and restores commonsense regulation as part of my broader plan to ease the burden for struggling families today while investing in a better future," Obama said in a campaign statement.
Obama's campaign blamed the loophole on former Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who serves as Republican candidate Sen. John McCain's co-chairman and economic adviser.
The Obama campaign accused Gramm of inserting a provision into a bill in late 2000 "at the behest of Enron lobbyists" that exempted some energy traders from government oversight.
Houston-based Enron collapsed in scandal in 2001 when it was discovered the company had vastly overstated its income.
McCain spokesman Tucker Bonds said McCain has supported efforts to close the loophole and noted the bill in question was signed into law by former President Clinton.
"The fact that Barack Obama is attacking John McCain, despite McCain's leadership on the issue, shows that Barack Obama is driven by the partisan attacks that Americans are tired of," Bounds said.
LONDON, England (CNN) Supermodel Naomi Campbell has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service after pleading guilty to assaulting two police officers following an "air rage" incident at London's Heathrow Airport.
According to the British Press Association, the 38-year-old pleaded guilty at Uxbridge magistrates' court, west London to two counts of assaulting a police officer, one count of disorderly conduct likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress and using threatening, abusive words or behaviour to cabin crew.

The latest death toll report is little changed from a week ago when the confirmed number killed was put at 69,170.
The number of injured from the quake was also barely changed, but 12 more than a week earlier.

Strict inspections will be in place when South Korea resumes importation of U.S. beef, following a public outcry over concerns about mad cow disease.
¡°Please prepare sufficient quarantine inspection measures ahead of imports, fully reflecting the results of the additional talks,¡± Prime Minister Han Seung-soo said at a meeting with agriculture officials, the Yonhap news agency reported.
U.S. beef imports are expected to resume this month.
A revised agreement between Seoul and Washington was confirmed on Saturday after a series of negotiations.
It allows for the resumption of imports of American beef, but not from cattle older than 30 months, including the exclusion of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease.
The initial deal that would have allowed the import of almost all U.S. beef prompted widespread public protests shortly after it was announced in April, essentially paralyzing the government of President Lee Myung-bak.
Zimbabwe opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai said Sunday he would not participate in Friday's presidential runoff, provoking dismay from international observers and handing an apparent victory to President Robert Mugabe.
"A free and fair election is impossible," Tsvangirai told reporters Sunday. "We in the MDC have resolved that we will no longer participate in this violent, illegitimate ... sham of an election process.
Mugabe, who has been Zimbabwe's only leader since it gained independence from Britain in 1980, was facing his toughest re-election battle yet.
Tsvangirai led Mugabe in the March 29 election, but failed to win enough votes to avoid a runoff.
Patrick Chinamasa, Zimbabwe's justice minister, denied the MDC's allegations of intimidation and said Tsvangirai was dropping out to avoid "a humiliating defeat."
But Britain, the former colonial power in Zimbabwe, blasted Mugabe's government for claiming a "tainted" victory built on "state-sponsored violence.
"I think the people around Robert Mugabe realize that power is ebbing away, and it's vital that they realize that there is no future other than a bleak one for a Mugabe regime that seeks to hang onto power at the barrel of a gun," British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said.
The Southern African Development Community has called on Mugabe to postpone Friday's vote.
And in a statement issued Sunday evening in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's office called for an immediate end to "the campaign of violence and intimidation that has marred this election.
LONDON, England (CNN) Singer Amy Winehouse has lung damage and irregular heart beat, says her father.
Soul diva Amy Winehouse has damaged her lungs by smoking crack cocaine and cigarettes, her father said in an interview published Sunday.
The Sunday Mirror quoted Mitch Winehouse as saying that Amy has an early stage emphysema and an irregular heartbeat, and has been warned that she will have to wear an oxygen mask unless she stops smoking drugs.
"There are nodules around the chest and dark marks. She has 70 percent lung capacity.
Winehouse collapsed at her north London home Monday after signing autographs for a group of fans and was taken to a London hospital for tests.
She remained there all week.
School administrators in Ohio voted Friday to begin the process of firing a middle school teacher accused of burning a cross into a student¡¯s arm and refusing to keep his religious beliefs out of the classroom.
The Mount Vernon School Board passed a resolution to terminate the employment of John Freshwater, an eighth-grade science teacher for the past 21 years.
Freshwater, according to an independent report, used an electrostatic device to mark a cross on the arm of one of his students &#8212; causing pain to the student the night of the incident and leaving a mark that lasted for approximately 3 weeks.
According to the Ohio Department of Education, the student¡¯s family has filed a lawsuit.
(CNN) &#8212; An Alabama man whose wife died during a honeymoon scuba diving trip off the coast of Australia almost five years ago has been charged with murdering her.
An Australian coroner ruled Friday there was enough evidence to put Gabe Watson on trial for the death of Tina Watson, who was 26 when she drowned in October 2003 while diving around a historic shipwreck in Australia¡¯s Great Barrier Reef.
Watson, 31, told police his new bride appeared to panic 45 feet underwater and that he ¡°looked into her eyes and saw her eyes were wide open but there was no response,¡± Townsville Coroner Glascow said in his inquest findings.
were inconsistencies in Watson¡¯s statements to investigators.
He said he was ¡°unable to conclude that Tina¡¯s death was an accidental drowning. ¡±
(CNN) The Olympic torch made its controversial passage through the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, Saturday with most local residents kept away.
But political rhetoric was present, according to a journalist who was there.
Australian journalist Stephen McDonell said ¡°it was quite bizarre¡± to watch a controlled crowd smile and wave as the flame arrived at the palace.
McDonell said it was obvious that ordinary Tibetans were not allowed to attend.
The local general secretary of the Communist party used the event to make a pro-China political statement against the Dalai Lama¡¯s government in exile, McDonell said.
He said the official declared that ¡°the stars of China will forever fly over Tibet and we can smash the Dalai clique. ¡±
(CNN) &#8212; Kidnappings, rape, slavery and murder shadow the lives of children in strife-torn countries, according to a United Nations Children¡¯s Fund report.
¡°It is everyone¡¯s duty to ensure children are safe from harm, and governments have a responsibility to enact and enforce measures that provide a protective environment for all children,¡± the agency said in a statement released Friday.
More than 50 children have been abducted in Haiti since the beginning of the year, adding to a growing trend of kidnappings in countries affected by violence, the agency reports.
In countries like the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iraq where armed conflicts, food shortages and poverty devastate peace, children have become the primary targets for armed groups who see them as commodities, the agency said.
MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) Police involved in a raid that sparked a fatal stampede at a nightclub in northern Mexico City on Friday have been suspended, and an investigation into the incident is under way, officials said Saturday.
Among the dead were a 13-year-old girl, a 16-year-old girl, a 14-year-old boy and three 18-year-old boys.
California firefighters Sunday were battling hundreds of wildfires, including one in Napa County that led to evacuations of about 250 homes, the state¡¯s fire department said.
At least 602 fires started after about 5,000 lightning strikes since Friday evening, said Mike Jarvis, spokesman for the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
¡°It was just pretty crazy,¡± he told CNN Sunday Morning.
The blazes were part of the fall-out from triple-digit temperatures.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (CNN) &#8212; Saudi King Abdullah confirmed Sunday that his country will increase daily oil production from 9 million barrels to 9.7 million in the near future to counter the sharp rise in international oil prices.
The Saudi petroleum minister, Ali I. Al-Naimi, said the country will reach the 9.7 million level by July.
The annoucement comes after Saudi officials have announced modest increases.
It would be Saudi Arabia¡¯s highest production rate since 1981.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Tony Fratto praised the step, saying, ¡°Any increase in production in today¡¯s oil market is welcome.
It is important that we also take steps to increase domestic production and our refining capacity. ¡±
MANILA, Philippines (CNN) &#8212; Filipino Coast Guard rescuers knocked on the overturned hull of a capsized ferry Sunday evening, hoping to hear any sign of life among the 749 missing passengers, a Red Cross official told CNN.
No sounds were returned, and the Coast Guard wrapped up their rescue mission for the night.
Heavy seas prevented divers from getting underneath the capsized vessel.
¡°It¡¯s a race against time,¡± said Philippines Sen. Richard Gordon, head of the Philippines Red Cross.
WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; Days after both men reversed course on major issues, the presidential campaigns of Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain spent much of Sunday¡¯s talk-show circuit working to ensure accusations of ¡°flip-flopping¡± don¡¯t stick.
Both sides tried to go on offense, with the Obama camp accusing McCain of ¡°yet another flip-flop,¡± and McCain¡¯s camp saying Obama has broken his word. In the 2004 race, similar accusations helped President Bush defeat Sen. John Kerry.
Last week, Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, reversed himself by announcing he would give up public financing for the general election and rely on private contributions, while McCain, his expected Republican rival, said came out in favor of lifting a federal ban on offshore oil drilling he once supported.
From the beach of Lake Willoughby's Southwest Cove, the sheer cliffs of Mount Pisgah tower over the deep, frigid water.
Across the narrows, Mount Hor's peak completes the look of a Scandinavian fjord.
In the summertime, the beach offers a different view:
Southwest Cove is one of the most famous nude beaches in the country, but there's a move under way to make people put their suits back on.
For decades, people have come to visit the beach, which is listed in nudist guides and on Web sites.
The beach is on public land that isn't visible from the highway.
The state which has no laws banning public nudity advises visitors with a sign at a trail head leading to the beach that warns "be advised, you may encounter nude bathers.
But some Westmore residents want to be able to use the beach without having to worry they or their kids will confront a naked person.
They're pushing the town to pass an anti-nudity ordinance.
"For me, it's about common public decency getting families and kids and people and Westmore back down to what they all talk about as being the most beautiful place, and they don't go there any more," said Tony Strange, who lives about a half-mile from South Cove and helped circulate a petition asking the Select Board to enact the ordinance.
Regulars say the nude beach is an accepted part of the area that doesn't cause any trouble.
On a recent hot Saturday afternoon, about 15 people were at the beach.
Other than the absence of swimsuits, there was nothing to distinguish it from a traditional beach:
People brought beach chairs and coolers, some paddled canoes, others just sunbathed.
"We try to make it clean, safe and enjoyable for everyone, that includes families with children, that includes anyone from anywhere, and yet we're being accused of dominating the area," said David Timson of St. Johnsbury, who has been going to Southwest Cove for 20 years. He is head of a newly formed organization called Friends of Southwest Cove.
Almost one year after the original Apple iPhone went on sale, Apple CEO Steve Jobs has announced a 3G version of the device, finally putting to rest months of rumors and speculation.
While some of the rumors panned out the new handset will offer full GPS other rumors, like the addition of a 32GB model, fizzled.
But even with the long list of basic features that Apple still is denying us (hello, multimedia messaging?), the addition of 3G support is a big win.
If data speeds hold up as Jobs demonstrated (more on that later), the new iPhone really will put the Internet in your pocket.
$199 for the 8GB model and $299 for the 16GB version, a pleasing price for all but the poor souls who shelled out nearly $600 a year ago.
The new iPhone will go on sale July 11.
Though the iPhone 3G is thinner at the edges than its predecessor, the phone measures a hair thicker (0.48 inches versus 0.46 inches) in the gut.
The other measurements are the same except that it weighs just the slightest bit less (4.7 ounces versus 4.8 ounces).
Otherwise, the iPhone 3G shows few cosmetic changes from the front same display size and resolution, and the single Home button sits just below the screen.
We're very pleased to see that Apple has done away with the irritating recessed headphone jack, which now is flush so that you'll be able to use any 3.5mm headphones you like.
It also offers live tracking so you can monitor your progress as you drive (or walk) along.
We're excited to see this feature as well, as it fills in another gaping hole on the original handset.
But now it appears that Apple has solved that problem.
In just five hours, the new version of the Firefox Web browser had as many downloads as its predecessor got during its entire first day, the software's developers say.
Firefox 3 reached 1.6 million downloads by early evening Tuesday to match Firefox 2's first-day downloads.
In the opening hours, Firefox's Web site was distributing nearly 9,000 copies of the free software every minute.
Downloads continued Wednesday as Firefox supporters sought to set a world record for most software downloads in a 24-hour period.
The category is new, and Guinness World Records must certify it, a process that could take a week or longer.
The site was slow or unreachable for about two hours starting about 12:45 p.m. Eastern time, 15 minutes before the scheduled release time, according to AlertSite, an Internet performance monitoring company.
Firefox comes from Mozilla, an open-source community in which thousands of people, mostly volunteers, collectively develop free products.
Firefox is the No. 2 Web browser behind Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer.
Firefox 3 includes enhancements to help users organize their frequently visited Web sites and block access to sites known to distribute viruses and other malicious software.
Firefox 3 also offers other design and speed improvements.

Six snorkelers wading like ducks in a row, cruising just below the surface of the water while watching exotic fish dart beneath them.
It was all very peaceful, until the mysterious whale shark appeared out of the deep blue.
The whale shark is one of the most perplexing and elusive creatures in the ocean, still largely a mystery even to the marine biologists who have dedicated careers to studying the creatures.
But here, in the confines of the Georgia Aquarium in downtown Atlanta, it's impossible not to see the giant whale sharks particularly when you're in the middle of their fish tank.
It's also somewhat hard to avoid them:
The creatures seemed more intrigued by the visitors, often lumbering toward them like a slow, curious locomotive.
The guests were circling the world's largest fish tank through the aquarium's "Swim with Gentle Giants" program, which plucks six snorkelers and six divers into the 6.3-million gallon fish tank each day.
The visitors are treated to close-up encounters of roving bands of sting rays, sleek hammerhead sharks, enormous grouper and countless other species.
But the puzzling whale sharks were the real draw and for good reason.
The aquarium is the only outside Asia to house the whale sharks, and the only in the world to offer tourists a chance to dive with the creatures.
The program's directors pitch it as an innovative and safe way to help visitors better understand animals they'd otherwise never see.
"An immersion experience is the ultimate way of connecting people and animals," said Bruce Carlson, the aquarium's chief science officer.
"It's a real opportunity for us to expand ways for people to get to know the animals here at the aquarium and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our visitors to see animals they'll probably never get a chance to see in the wild.
WASHINGTON (CNN) A cyclone wrecks coastal Myanmar, spawning outbreaks of malaria, cholera and dengue fever.
Flooding inundates Iowa, raising an array of public health concerns.
As these disasters draw attention to weather hazards, which many fear could be exacerbated by climate change, scientists are working to be able to better predict health dangers as they forecast the weather.
"Everything is connected in our Earth system," Conrad Lautenbacher, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said at a panel on "Changing Climate: Changing Health Patterns.
The key is bringing all types of data together: health, weather, human behavior, disasters and others. "It's science without borders," Lautenbacher said.
He said 73 countries and more than 50 international organizations are participating in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, and more are expected to join.
"It's a full court press" to observe what's going on on the Earth, he said. When it comes to health and disasters, "we can't afford to be wrong a lot of the time. We have got to get ahead of it.
Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, noted that "we have these very modern technologies that are very good at sensing atmosphere and Earth surfaces, and you can put them in computers and model some of these weather events ... and we're pretty good at it right now.
Take a disease like cholera, Lautenbacher said.
Research has shown that outbreaks in India vary with the temperature of the Bay of Bengal.
Satellites can measure that temperature.
In addition, climate researchers are doing forecasts of the Pacific Ocean phenomenon known as El Ni&ntilde;
o, which affects temperatures in the bay, so that might also be used to forecast cholera.
The problem was discovered late Tuesday after the spacecraft dug a trench inside a polygon-shaped surface feature that was likely caused by seasonal expansion and shrinking of ice.
Scientists said the lost data wasn't crucial.
"It's unfortunate to lose any bit of science," said mission scientist Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis. "But it's not really critical stuff that you kick yourself over.
Engineers noticed Phoenix's strange behavior when it sent a piece of engineering data 45,000 times like a broken record.
Normally, the lander would store the day's work in its flash memory, but the repeated data caused it to power down for the night without saving everything.
"We're rather annoyed," said project manager Barry Goldstein of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the $420 million mission.
Engineers overcame the bug, but its cause remained unknown.
Wednesday's digging was delayed to not stress Phoenix's memory.
Badminton matches look so real playing on Hyundai's new 3-D TV that you may reflexively dodge the virtual shuttlecock.
Hyundai is offering in Japan only the first product for watching the 3-D programs that cable stations in Japan now broadcast about four times a day.
and the only programs available so far include just a few minutes of video from Japan's northern island of Hokkaido shots from the zoo, motorcycle races and other short scenes.
Seen on regular TVs, 3D programs split the screen vertically so the same image appears in both the left and right halves.
Conversely, wearing the 3-D glasses while watching regular programming on the Hyundai 3-D TV produces a slight 3-D effect.
The TV uses stereoscopic technology called TriDef from DDD Group Plc in Santa Monica, California, which works by sending the same image separately for the left eye and the right eye.
Ryo Saito of BS 11, the cable channel that runs the 3-D shows, says more content is needed for the technology to catch on, and other manufacturers need to start making 3-D televisions.
"People are showing interest in 3-D programs, but most homes don't have the special TVs," he said.
Samsung already sells 3-D rear projection TVs in the U.S., but there are no 3-D TV broadcasts in the United States.
The technology is also available on desktop monitors and for video games.
JACKSON, Mississippi (CNN) Jamie Lynn Spears gave birth to a girl Thursday morning at a south Mississippi hospital, according to a person close to the Spears family.
The person confirmed the baby's birth but asked not to be identified because the family had not announced the baby's birth.
The 17-year-old was the star of Nickelodeon's "Zoey 101," a sitcom about prep school friends, and is the younger sister of pop star Britney Spears.
The Spears family announced in December that Jamie Lynn was pregnant.
The father is Casey Aldridge, a pipe-layer from Liberty, Mississippi.
The couple is not married but announced an engagement several months ago.
The younger Spears lives near Liberty with Aldridge, 19, and has been seen around the small south Mississippi town often as her pregnancy became more apparent.
Her family owns a home across the state line in Kentwood, Louisiana.

BALTIMORE, Maryland (CNN) For one night, at least, tattoos and the living canvases that carry them took their place alongside Rembrandt, Matisse and Picasso.
The Baltimore Museum of Art celebrated the art of tattooing recently with a panel discussion among prominent tattoo artists, a runway show displaying the strongest output from local shops and high-minded discussions of the importance of body art among African tribes and Japanese laborers.
"There has never been this many tattooed people in one room in a museum that haven't been asked to leave," said Bob Baxter, editor of Skin & Ink magazine.

(CNN) Prince Harry paraded alongside his fellow British servicemen in Scotland Wednesday, as he attended a memorial to service members who have died in Afghanistan.
Harry, 23, serves in the British Army and spent 10 weeks in Afghanistan earlier this year.
He was withdrawn unexpectedly in March after news leaked out about his low-key deployment.
The prince appeared in uniform alongside around 200 other sailors, soldiers, marines and airmen at the parade, which took place on Edinburgh's famous Royal Mile.
They made their way to St. Giles' Cathedral for a private memorial and thanksgiving service for the fallen service members.
Also attending the service was British Defense Secretary Des Browne, families of the fallen troops, and recovering wounded military personnel.
The parade and memorial service took place on the same day Britain's Ministry of Defense announced the deaths of four British soldiers in Afghanistan, and two days after Browne announced Britain will increase its presence in Afghanistan from 7,800 troops to 8,030 by next spring.
Prince Harry is the younger son of Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and the late Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.
BEIJING, China (CNN) What's in a name?
Local dishes like "Husband and wife's lung slice" or "Chicken without sexual life" conjure lots of furrowed eyebrows on famished foreigners.
So, with the Olympics a few short weeks away, China is giving its cuisine a linguistic makeover.
It is proposing that restaurants change the names of exotic, but bizarrely named, delicacies to make them more delectable for the estimated 50,000 visitors arriving in August for the Summer Games.
The appetizer "Husband and wife's lung slice" is taking on the more appetizing "Beef and ox tripe in chili sauce.
"Chicken without sexual life" has been transformed into "Steamed pullet.
The government has put down more than 2,000 proposed names in a 170-page book that it has offered to Beijing hotels, according to state media.
"Thanks to the pamphlet, we do not have to struggle to come up with the English translations of dishes any more, which is usually time consuming," a senior manager at the four-star Guangzhou Hotel in downtown Beijing told the Xinhua news agency.
But Westerners are more accustomed to names that describe the ingredients and how they are cooked such as pot roast.
ZAM ZAM DISPLACEMENT CAMP, Sudan (CNN) Sudan's Darfur crisis has exploded on many fronts violence, hunger, displacement and looting but United Nations peacekeepers say the biggest issue now affecting the region is the systematic rape of women and children.
Thousands of women as young as 4 caught in the middle of the struggle between rebel forces and government-backed militias have become victims of rape, they say, with some aid groups claiming that it is being used as a weapon of ethnic cleansing.
the rapes, and crimes against women and children," said Michael Fryer, police commissioner of UNAMID, the United Nations peacekeeping force deployed to try to tackle the violence.
Relief workers say they are powerless to stop the attacks and say that if they do speak out, they fear that the Sudanese government will tell them to leave the country.
Some relief workers say that almost every woman living in aid camps has been raped or become a victim of gender-based violence.
Many teenagers, while out running errands such as collecting firewood, are raped multiple times by militiamen, the workers say.
They say the situation has now become so bad that many women are now resigned to rape as a way of life and men are unwilling to accompany them because they fear that they will be killed if they try to defend them.
SDEROT, Israel (CNN) &#8212; Israeli children Thursday morning toted colorful backpacks to school in this town on the Gaza border, on the first day of a truce that Israel hopes will end the barrage of rockets that have pummeled Sderot in recent months.
Meanwhile, in Gaza, people gathered around fruit stands, men sat in chairs chatting on the streets, and black-clad Hamas forces patrolled some neighborhoods as the cease-fire took effect at 6 a.m. (11 p.m. Wednesday ET).
But one Gaza resident voiced skepticism that the Egyptian-brokered agreement between Israel and Gaza¡¯s Hamas leadership will last.
¡°We are not optimistic because the Israeli side always violates any calm,¡± he said. ¡°As Palestinians, people and factions, we all support this calm. We just want to live in peace. ¡±
BRUSSELS, Belgium (CNN) &#8212; Members of the European Union decided Thursday to lift sanctions on Cuba, a spokeswoman for EU Secretary-General Javier Solana told CNN.
Christina Gallach said the decision, made over dinner during the first day of a planned two-day summit here, will be formally confirmed on Monday during an EU council meeting.
The diplomatic sanctions, which limited visits to the Communist island by senior EU personnel, were imposed in 2003 after concerns were raised about human rights in Cuba.
They had been suspended in 2005.
Plans call for the human rights situation to be reviewed next year.
WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; A drunken passenger who tried to light the curtains of a Boeing 767 on fire during a transatlantic flight is in custody in Vienna, Austria, the Transportation Security Administration said Thursday.
Zoltan Lensky, 25, a Slovakian citizen, was on Delta Flight 40 from Atlanta, Georgia, to Vienna Wednesday night when flight attendants refused his request for more liquor.
According to TSA spokesman Christopher White, Lensky slapped a flight attendant on the hand, moved forward in the cabin, pulled out a lighter and tried to ignite the curtains around the flight attendants¡¯ rest area.
Lensky was handed over to authorities in Vienna when the flight landed.
What was believed to be the sixth human foot to wash up on the shores of British Columbia in recent months was a fake, authorities said Thursday.
The British Columbia Coroners Service confirmed that the remains found in a shoe on Wednesday were a ¡°skeletonised animal paw¡± that was put in the shoe with a sock and packed with dried seaweed.
¡°It is the position of BCCS that this type of hoax is reprehensible and very disrespectful to the families of missing persons,¡± said a written statement from the group.
¡°It fuels inappropriate speculation and creates undue anxiety for families and communities while wasting valuable investigative time and resources that could be spent on the main investigations.
Authorities are investigating multiple possibilities on the origin of the five feet that have washed up in the past 11 months &#8212; from foul play to the possibility they belonged to victims of a plane crash.
(CNN) &#8212; Saudi Arabia is increasing its oil output by 200,000 barrels per day, and the kingdom will convene an international meeting of oil producing and consuming nations to deal with the problem of rising oil prices, according to a statement on the country¡¯s British Embassy Web site.
The United Nations had said earlier that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had been told of both moves over the past weekend.
The meeting will be held Sunday in Jeddah, with as many as 38 countries, four international organizations and 30 oil companies agreeing to attend, according to the statement, posted Thursday.
KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) &#8212; Nepalese authorities Thursday arrested at least 650 Tibetan exiles protesting against China¡¯s policies in the province ahead of this weekend¡¯s Olympic torch relay in Tibet, security officials in Kathmandu said.
It is the largest single-day arrest of Tibetan protesters in Nepal since the demonstrations broke out in March following China¡¯s bloody crackdown on protesters in Tibet.
Nepalese police forcefully dragged some of the protesters to awaiting vans and drove them to police stations across the capital city.
¡°They have been arrested for damaging the diplomatic relations between Nepal and China,¡± said civilian security officer Jaya Mukunda Khanal.
The attack occurred at the Bonga oil facility, which is 65 miles

Obama has vastly outraised McCain, who now faces a huge cash disadvantage.
A day after Northwest Airlines announced it was scaling back domestic flights, Delta Air Lines did the same Wednesday &#8212; announcing a 3 percent cut for the second half of 2008.
The decrease comes after Delta announced plans in March for a 10 percent reduction in capacity.
But the Atlanta-based company said it had to increased its cuts further because of the rising costs of fuel.
Delta estimates that fuel could cost $4 billion more in 2008 than in 2007.
The airline has implemented fare increases, a hedging program that allows the company to get contracts on oil prices below the market rate, and offered early-retirement incentives to employees to help cover the higher than expected fuel cost, according to a Delta spokesperson.
High fuel prices have caused cutbacks throughout the airline industry.
This year, United, Continental and US Airways also have announced plans to ground flights because of costs.
On Tuesday, Northwest Airlines announced it was cutting back on domestic capacity 8.5 percent in the fourth quarter due to oil prices.
KINGSTON, Iowa (CNN) Luck ran out for about a dozen pigs who escaped their flooded farm, swam through raging floodwaters and scrambled atop a sandbag levee in southeastern Iowa.
Des Moines County sheriff's officials shot the pigs Tuesday, not long after they reached the levee several miles from the nearest hog farm.
Officials said they killed the pigs over worries that they would weaken the levee.
"Basically you cannot have something with a hoof walk on plastic and not poke a hole in the plastic and let water into it," said LeRoy Lippert, chairman of the county emergency management commission. "Hogs, they have a tendency to root and that would not have been good either.
He said the state veterinarian and other agencies were consulted, and that 10 to 16 animals were killed.
SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) &#8212; South Korean President Lee Myung-bak plans to deliver his second apology in a month Thursday over his handling of plans to resume U.S. beef imports, state media reported.
His administration has been embroiled in controversy since reaching an agreement with Washington in April to allow American beef back into the country after a five-year ban imposed amid concerns of mad cow disease.
¡°Lee will speak to the nation on national television at 2 p.m. (1 a.m. ET) to explain South Korea¡¯s efforts to revise the beef import deal,¡± presidential aides told the Yonhap news agency
Tiger Woods will miss the rest of the season because of surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee, an injury that has troubled him for last 10 months despite winning nine of 12 tournaments.
Woods also said he suffered a double stress fracture of his left tibia while preparing to return to the PGA Tour last month, which forced him to miss the Memorial and was the source of his pain at Torrey Pines where he won the U.S. Open.
He had arthroscopic surgery April 15 to clean out cartilage in his left knee, bypassing ACL surgery with hopes it could get him through the 2008 season.
But going 91 holes for his 14th career major made it impossible to play any longer.
"Now, it is clear that the right thing to do is to listen to my doctors, follow through with this surgery and focus my attention on rehabilitating my knee," Woods said.
Woods was last seen in public late Monday afternoon walking with a pronounced limp across Torrey Pines toward the parking lot, the U.S. Open trophy in his arms.
"Although I will miss the rest of the 2008 season, I'm thrilled with the fact that last week was such a special tournament," Woods said.
Sen. Barack Obama is leading Sen. John McCain in the crucial swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, according to a new survey.
Obama lost the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania by 9 percentage points.
But a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday shows him leading McCain by 12 points, 52 to 40 percent.
In Ohio, a state Obama lost to Sen. Hillary Clinton by 10 points in March, he's leading McCain 48 to 42 percent.
And in Florida, where he did not campaign this primary season and lost an unsanctioned Democratic contest, he leads McCain 47 to 43 percent.
The Ohio and Florida results are reversals from Quinnipiac polls published a month ago, when Clinton was still in the race and McCain led Obama in hypothetical match-ups.
In the waning days of her campaign, Clinton argued to voters and superdelegates that she should be the nominee because she was the stronger candidate to beat McCain in these swing states during the general election.
Florida clinched the presidency for George W. Bush in 2000, and Ohio did the same in 2004.
The polls had margins of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for Pennsylvania and 2.6 percentage points for Ohio and Florida.
ZURICH, Switzerland (CNN) Swiss television has made an embarrassing mistake in broadcasting a Euro 2008 soccer match.
National broadcaster SRG turned back time on Monday when it offered subtitles accompanying Germany's national anthem that mistakenly included the "Deutschland, Deutschland ueber alles" lyrics, a first verse ignored since the fall of the Third Reich.
The faux pas occurred during the channel's live coverage of Austria vs. Germany at the European Championship, with the mass circulation daily Blick showing a picture of fans singing the anthem.
Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, Rice said that ¡°North Korea will soon give its declaration of nuclear programs to China.
¡± China is the host of the six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea¡¯s nuclear program, along with Russia, South Korea, Japan and the U.S.
Rice spoke in advance of her upcoming trip to Asia where she will be attending a meeting of G8 foreign ministers and meeting with her Asian counterparts .
Rice said once North Korea submits its declaration, President Bush will notify Congress he intends to remove North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and scrap some sanctions levied against North Korea because of nuclear concerns.
WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; Medical examinations of former terrorist suspects detained by the United States at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Afghanistan revealed evidence of torture, according to a report released Wednesday by a human rights group.
The Massachusetts-based group Physicians for Human Rights reached that conclusion after carrying out two-day clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees who were never charged with crimes.
The doctors¡¯ group said in a 121-page report that it uncovered medical evidence of torture, including beatings, electric shock, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation, sodomy and scores of other abuses.
(CNN) &#8212; A former University of South Florida student who made a videotape showing how to make and use a remote-controlled bomb pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to providing material support to terrorists, authorities said.
Ahmed Abdellatif Sherif Mohamed, 26, could be sent to prison for 15 years when he is sentenced, according to federal prosecutors.
A sentencing date was not set.
Under the plea agreement, in return for Mohamed¡¯s guilty plea, six other charges against him were dropped.
JERUSALEM (CNN) Palestinian militants and the Israeli military traded violent attacks Wednesday, a day before a truce was scheduled to take effect, according to the Israeli military and Hamas.
Palestinian militants fired more than two dozen rockets and mortars on southern Israel, but there were no casualties, the Israeli military said.
Israeli aircraft responded by targeting two rocket-launching sites in northern Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
One of the airstrikes killed an Islamic Jihad militant and injured four others, Hamas sources in Gaza said.
(CNN) A severed foot the sixth in 11 months washed up on the shore of a Canadian island on Wednesday, police said.
The right foot was found by a woman walking on the beach, said Sgt. Mike Tresoor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the town of Campbell River on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.
"A local citizen walking on a beach in Tyee Spit located what appears to be human remains of a right foot in an approximate size 10 black Adidas running shoe," police said in a written statement.
The foot will be examined by a forensic pathologist, and DNA testing will be requested, said the statement posted on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Web site.
The number of cases of sickness caused by tomatoes has risen in recent days, with a total of 383 people having been infected since April with a rare form of salmonella in 30 states and the District of Columbia, federal health officials said Wednesday.
At least 48 of the victims, who range in age from less than 1 year to 88 years, have been hospitalized, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters on a conference call.
No deaths have officially been blamed on the outbreak, but the infection may have contributed to the death in Texas of a man in his 60s who also had cancer, the CDC said.
The increase reported Wednesday resulted not from a large number of new cases but from improved surveillance by state health departments in response to the outbreak and from the fact that laboratories completed analyzing previously submitted samples, said Dr. David Acheson, associate commissioner for foods at the Food and Drug Administration.
LONDON, England (CNN) &#8212; Britain¡¯s Home Secretary said Wednesday she was ¡°extremely disappointed¡± at a court¡¯s decision to release on bail a radical Muslim cleric known as Osama bin Laden¡¯s spiritual ambassador to Europe.
A three-judge appeals panel released Jordanian national Abu Qatada on Tuesday on strict bail conditions, including a 22-hour curfew.
The judges said there was no reason to continue holding him but that he presented a ¡°continuing and significant¡± threat.
¡°The government¡¯s priority is to protect public safety and national security and we will take all steps necessary to do so,¡± Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said in a statement.
Bush also renewed his demand that Congress allow drilling in Alaska¡¯s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, clear the way for more refineries and encourage efforts to recover oil from shale in areas such as the Green River Basin of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.
Bush said that the basin potentially contains more than three times as much recoverable oil as Saudi Arabia¡¯s proven reserves, and that the high price of oil makes it profitable to extract it.
¡°In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply here at home,¡± said Bush, adding there is no more pressing issue than gas prices for many Americans.
(CNN) With the general election campaign now in full bloom, Michelle Obama &#8212; wife of presumptive Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama &#8212; is honing her message for the fall, aides say.
¡°We have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver. So she¡¯s really working on it as we speak.
Aides said Michelle Obama¡¯s new speeches will include more details about her family and humble upbringing on Chicago¡¯s southside.
(CNN) Some fans of the band Chicago thought this day would never come.
Many have waited 15 years for it.
An album the band recorded in 1993 finally goes on sale Tuesday, long after a squabble between the group and its former record company shelved the project.
¡°I am waaaaay excited about this,¡± said a fan nicknamed ¡°sprout.
¡± ¡°I¡¯ve been hearing about these songs for years, and now I¡¯ll actually get to hear them for myself! Yea!!!!!!
¡°I am really glad to see Rhino finally releasing a forgotten ¡¦ masterpiece,¡± another fan said.
The album, "Stone of Sisyphus," takes its name from a character in Greek mythology who rolls a heavy stone up a hill only to have it roll back down again and again for eternity.
NEW YORK (CNN) Johnson & Johnson and the American Red Cross have resolved a lawsuit over the use of their shared red-and-white symbol.
The deal was announced Tuesday.
It comes after a federal judge tossed out most of health-products maker Johnson & Johnson's lawsuit, upholding the Red Cross' right to use the emblem.
The judge said the group also had leeway to use the logo to promote itself and raise money for its charitable works.
Johnson & Johnson had claimed the Red Cross illegally licensed its emblem to other companies, plunging the two organizations into a legal dispute.
The companies say in a joint statement that it is "more productive" to accept the judge's rulings and set aside the remaining disagreements.
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) Is the white stuff in the Martian soil ice or salt?
That's the question bedeviling scientists in the three weeks since the Phoenix lander began digging into Mars' north pole region to study whether the arctic could be habitable.
Shallow trenches excavated by the lander's backhoe-like robotic arm have turned up specks and at times even stripes of mysterious white material mixed in with the clumpy, reddish dirt.
Phoenix merged two previously dug trenches over the weekend into a single pit measuring a little over a foot long and 3 inches deep.
The new trench was excavated at the edge of a polygon-shaped pattern in the ground that may have been formed by the seasonal melting of underground ice.
New photos showed the exposed bright substance present only in the top part of the trench, suggesting it's not uniform throughout the excavation site.
Phoenix will take images of the trench dubbed "Dodo-Goldilocks" over the next few days to record any changes.
If it's ice, scientists expect it to sublimate or go from solid to gas, bypassing the liquid stage when exposed to the sun because of the planet's frigid temperatures and low atmospheric pressure.
Even if it's not ice, the discovery of salt would also be significant because it's normally formed when water evaporates in the soil.
KASHGAR, China (CNN) Hundreds of security personnel lined the streets to head off any disruption, as the Olympic torch relay resumed Wednesday in western China's restive Muslim region of Xinjiang.
Foreign journalists were not allowed along the route, where cheering bystanders shouted "Go China!" under sunny skies.
Also Wednesday, Olympic torch relay organizers said the flame will make a one-day stop in Tibet's capital of Lhasa on Saturday.
That leg has been shrouded in secrecy because of political sensitivities surrounding Tibet.
The route has been criticized by Tibet activist groups who see it as an attempt by Beijing to symbolize its control over the Himalayan region.
HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) &#8212; Former Cuban President Fidel Castro appeared Tuesday in a video broadcast on Cuban television, the first scenes of the ailing revolutionary leader released since January.
In a scene broadcast on a state-run Cuban television news program, the 81-year-old Castro spoke animatedly with his younger brother, Raul, who succeeded him as president in February; and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
It was not possible to hear what they were discussing.
During part of the video, the elder Castro is standing.
Fidel Castro, who led the island¡¯s 1959 communist revolution, has not been seen in public since intestinal surgery in July 2006.
He temporarily transferred power to Raul at that time, and permanently relinquished Cuba¡¯s presidency to him in February.
President Cristina Fernandez on Tuesday defended an increase in export taxes on grains that has riled many farmers, and she called on them to respect the law in protesting her policies.
¡°But we were always respectful of the popular will.
Fernandez, of the center-left Peronist movement, made her plea for comity a day after massive demonstrations in various cities blocked traffic and paralyzed much of the country.
In a concession to her critics, she said the tax increase she imposed in March will be debated by Congress &#8212;
but since her party controls both houses, there is little likelihood of major changes.
Former Vice President Al Gore endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday, urging Americans to reject what he called the Bush administration's legacy of "incompetence, negligence and failure.
"Americans simply cannot afford to continue the policies of the last eight years for another four," Gore, the party's 2000 presidential nominee, told Obama supporters at a rally in Detroit, Michigan.
Perceived as a senior statesman in the Democratic party, Gore brings a certain force to Obama's campaign, political analysts have said.
Monday marked Gore's debut in the 2008 election;
he had not weighed in while Obama was still battling Sen. Hillary Clinton.
Amid thousands of cheering supporters, Gore began by addressing head-on the criticism that Obama doesn't have enough experience to lead the nation.
The former vice president turned Nobel Prize winner playfully said he recalled one Republican nominee wondering out loud whether his Democratic rival for president was "naive and inexperienced.
"And yet another said the United States cannot afford to risk the future of the free world with inexperience and immaturity in the White House," said Gore. "Who were they talking about?
Every single one of those quotes came from the campaign of 1960, when the the Republicans attacked John Fitzgerald Kennedy for allegedly lacking the age and experience necessary to be president.
Joining Obama in the midst of the candidate's two week swing through the nation to talk about his plans to revitalize the economy, Gore praised Obama as someone who could mobilize people, young and old, who had never before taken part in politics.

Oil prices briefly spiked more than $5 per barrel to a trading record Monday, but crude tumbled throughout the afternoon as traders took profits after prices couldn't get over the $140 a barrel hump.
Light, sweet crude for July delivery edged 25 cents lower to settle at $134.61.
That's a sharp drop from the session high of $139.89, set just before 9 a.m. ET.
Oil initially surged as the dollar weakened after the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, which monitors manufacturing capacity in New York State, indicated deteriorating business conditions in June.
"The dollar took a pounding in early morning trading, leading to a steep rise in oil prices," said Stephen Schork, editor of the energy industry newsletter The Schork Report.
But after several attempts to pass $140 stalled throughout the morning, oil quickly tumbled in the afternoon hours.
"Everyone who tried buying in the morning decided it wasn't going higher, so they sold off," added Schork. "They were gunning for $140, and then the bulls and bears slugged it out.
Schork still thinks the bulls will win the fight, and oil could top $150 a barrel by next Monday.
"The market hasn't moved much higher since it rose nearly $17 June 5th and 6th, but there hasn't been a corrective sell-off either.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (CNN) Annual inflation in the euro zone rose to a new high of 3.7 percent in May, according to data released Monday that reflects surging food, fuel and housing prices across the 15-nation currency bloc.
The main drivers of inflation were food prices that jumped 6.4 percent over the year, transport costs that rose 5.9 percent and housing, which rose 5.7 percent, Eurostat said.
Rising inflation increases the pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interests at its next meeting, despite the risk of slowing growth amid a global financial crisis, a possible U.S. recession and soaring energy costs.

The U.N. secretary-general met with Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi in the port city of Jiddah during a one-day trip to the world's largest oil producer.
Farhan Haq, a spokesman who is traveling with Ban, said in an e-mail that the U.N. chief said al-Naimi told him Saudi Arabia would increase oil production by 200,000 barrels a day from June to July.
In May, the kingdom increased its production by 300,000.
By July, production should be at 9.7 million barrels a day, Haq said.
Ban also said Saudi Arabia understands that the current price of oil, which topped $139 per barrel earlier this month, is not normal, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
"The king believes that the current oil prices are abnormally high, and he is ready to restore prices to their appropriate levels," SPA quoted Ban as telling reporters in Jiddah.
(CNN) Tim Russert, who became one of America's leading political journalists as the host of NBC's "Meet the Press," died Friday, the network said.
He was taken to Washington's Sibley Memorial Hospital, where he died, the hospital confirmed.
Colleague and former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw broke the news on the network Friday shortly after 3:40 p.m.
Russert had just returned from a family vacation in Italy with his wife, journalist Maureen Orth, and son, Luke, to celebrate his graduation from Boston College, Brokaw said.
Buffalo Mayor Byron W. Brown ordered that all flags on city property be lowered immediately to half-staff in Russert's honor.
During his 17-year run as the host of "Meet the Press," the longest of any host in the show's 60-year history, Russert earned the respect and admiration of many journalists and politicians.
His professionalism earned him many accolades.
The Washingtonian Magazine once dubbed Russert the best and most influential journalist in Washington, describing "Meet the Press" as "the most interesting and important hour on television.
In 2008, TIME magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.
LONDON, England (CNN) The bishop of London said Sunday he would order an investigation into a wedding-like church service for two male priests.
The priests exchanged rings and vows in a service at one of London's oldest churches marked by a fanfare of trumpets and capped by a shower of confetti on May 31, Britain's Sunday Telegraph reported.
Rev. Richard Chartres said in a statement that such services were not authorized in the Church of England and said he would ask the archdeacon of London to investigate.
While civil partnerships between homosexual couples are officially recognized in Britain, the Church of England's guidelines ask clergy not to bless such partnerships.
The wedding ceremony is likely to anger conservative members of the Anglican Communion, a loose-knit worldwide Christian grouping which includes the U.S. Episcopal Church.
Conservatives are fiercely opposed to both same-sex partnerships and the ordaining of gay priests, and the issue threatens to tear the Anglicans apart.
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) He's pregnant.
After setting the mood with lighting and finessing, the Georgia Aquarium's attempts to coax rare sea dragons to mate have finally worked just in time for Father's Day.
The pregnant male weedy sea dragon is now only the third of its kind in the United States to successfully become pregnant outside of its natural habitat.
The sea dragon, found in nature only in the waters off southern Australia, became pregnant Tuesday when a female transferred her eggs onto his tail.
Dennis Christen, assistant manager of animal care and husbandry, said that male sea horses, sea dragons and pipe fish all carry the eggs instead of the female.
Christen said that recently the staff took steps to try to assist in mating.
They altered the mood by adjusting the lighting and thinning the plants, Christen said.
But so much is unknown about the creatures, including their mating routines, that a lot about the pregnancy remains a mystery, Christen said.
When the animals finally do mate, the sea dragons arch their tails and swim side by side until they latch onto each other before swimming vertically together during their version of a "date.
Of the 70 small pink eggs wrapped around the male's tail, nobody knows how many are viable and could actually hatch.
Christen said that they are relying on other experiences with breeding, where about 60 percent of the eggs survived, to estimate how things may go.
The eggs are expected to hatch in four to six weeks.
NEW YORK (CNN) A street-sweeping truck roaring down a Bronx street sucked up a dog and killed her as her owner held the leash.
Robert Machin said he had just finished walking his two Boston terriers and was about to put them into his car when the truck appeared Thursday morning.

CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) Barack Obama celebrated Father's Day by calling on black fathers, who he said are "missing from too many lives and too many homes," to become active in raising their children.
"They have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men. And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it," the Democratic presidential candidate said Sunday at a largely black church in his hometown.
Reminding the congregation of his firsthand experience growing up without a father, Obama said he was lucky to have loving grandparents who helped his mother.
"I resolved many years ago that it was my obligation to break the cycle that if I could be anything in life, I would be a good father to my girls," added Obama, whose daughters, Sasha and Malia, and his wife, Michelle, watched from the audience.
Obama's appearance at the Apostolic Church of God was his first address to a church since he ended his membership at Trinity United Church of Christ, where he had worshipped for 20 years, following inflammatory remarks there by his former longtime pastor and others.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) During the first seven years of their relationship, Judy Kelly doesn't remember her boyfriend, Bill Horrisberger, ever going to a doctor.
"On a scale of one to 10, Bill was a zero," Kelly remarked when asked about her partner's willingness to get an annual checkup.
It turns out Horrisberger, 62, a retired English teacher from Atlanta, Georgia, isn't the only man who is reluctant to put on a hospital gown.
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that American men are 25 percent less likely than women to visit a doctor.
"A lot of times, it's very difficult for them to be convinced that they need to see a physician for a problem," said Dr. Allen Dollar, a cardiologist with Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta. "To a large extent, there is a lot of denial going on, and in some cases, that denial can be deadly.
Dr. David Dodson, an expert on men's health at the Marino Center in Wellesley, Massachusetts, recommends that healthy men under 50 get a regular checkup every 18 months. After 50, he suggests, men should see their doctors annually.
As men age, Dodson said, they are more likely to develop high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
Those conditions can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.
"The older you get, the more important those exams are," Dodson said.
Around age 50, he wants men to be screened for colon and prostate cancer, in addition to regular blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar tests.
At least half his male patients end up making an appointment only after they've been prodded by a wife or other loved one, the doctor added.
LONDON, England (CNN) Jyoti is the Hindi word for light.
It's something Pranav Mehta has never had to live without.
And he is lucky.
Near where he lives in Gujarat, one of the most prosperous states in India, thousands of rural villages lack electricity or struggle with an intermittent supply at best.
Much of that electricity will come from coal-fired power plants, like the $4 billion so-called ultra mega complex scheduled to be built south of Tunda Wand, a tiny village near the Gulf of Kutch, an inlet of the Arabian Sea on India's west coast.
Dozens of other such projects are already or soon will be under way.
Yet Mehta has another solution for India's chronic electricity shortage, one that does not involve power plants on the ground but instead massive sun-gathering satellites in geosynchronous orbits 22,000 miles in the sky.
The satellites would electromagnetically beam gigawatts of solar energy back to ground-based receivers, where it would then be converted to electricity and transferred to power grids.
(CNN) Croatia sent out a message of intent to the other Euro 2008 finalists as they stunned highly-fancied Germany 2-1 in Klagenfurt to secure a place in the quarterfinals.
Darijo Srna and Ivica Olic struck the goals as Croatia, who had only ever beaten Germany once before, produced arguably the first major upset of the tournament.
Lukas Podolski pulled a goal back late on for Germany with his third strike in two games to set up a nail-biting finale, but there was to be no way back for Joachim Loew's team, who finished with 10 men following the 90th-minute dismissal of substitute Bastian Schweinsteiger .
Both sides came into the game having won their opening matches, although Germany had looked far more impressive in seeing off Poland than Croatia had in defeating Austria.

WASHINGTON (CNN) The day after Jim Johnson resigned from Sen. Barack Obama's vice presidential candidate vetting committee, Sen. John McCain set his sights on Eric Holder, one of the two remaining members of the committee.
"I think people in the media and observers will make a decision as to whether these people, individuals, should be part of Sen. Obama's campaign," McCain said in Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday.
"I think it is a matter of record that Mr. Holder recommended the pardoning of Mr. [Marc] Rich.
Rich was a commodities trader who fled to Europe in 1983 after tax evasion charges and allegations of illegal oil dealings with Iran.
He was pardoned by former President Clinton at the end of his second term, while Holder was deputy attorney general.
In a response Thursday, Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan said McCain was raising old allegations rather than talking about the issues.
"It's telling that John McCain whose vice presidential search process is headed by a prominent D.C. lobbyist who served as the Reagan administration's point man on the Iran-Contra scandal would try to recycle a tired attack on Mr. Holder," she said.

(CNN) Rebecca Safran has fooled Mother Nature.
The evolutionary biologist from the University of Colorado figured out a way to give male barn swallows a makeover that makes less popular males much more desirable to females.
And now, she and her colleagues have discovered that those artificial makeovers are having an unexpected effect.
About eight years ago, Safran expected to find that the length of a male barn swallow's tail feathers determined his level of success attracting mates and breeding.
Instead, she noticed something she didn't expect: Female barn swallows tended to choose mates with the darkest breast feathers.
Those males "bred a lot earlier, attracted the best mates and sired the greatest number of offspring," which Safran says is "the currency of evolution.
In the latest edition of the journal Current Biology, Safran and her colleagues report that they've followed up on the males with the magic marker makeovers and have found something surprising.
MONTERREY, Mexico (CNN) Manuel Uribe, who once weighed a half-ton but has slimmed down to about 700 pounds, celebrates his 43rd birthday Wednesday with a simple wish for the coming year: to be able to stand on his own two feet to get married.
At his home in northern Mexico, where he can still do little more than sit up on a bed, Uribe said that more than two years of steady dieting have helped him drop about 550 pounds from his Guinness record weight of 1,235 pounds.
He hopes Guinness representatives will confirm in July that he holds a second title: the world's greatest loser of weight.
But Uribe is still unable to walk with his fianc&eacute; e, Claudia Solis, down the aisle.
"It frustrates me a little, because it is not easy to get out," said Uribe, who has not been able to leave bed for the past six years.
But Uribe vowed not to be deterred:
"We are in love, and this year my birthday wish is to be able to stand when we get married," he said.

The accident occurred Monday morning while filming an action sequence in Beijing, the crew said in a statement.
A small boat was set ablaze and collided with a larger boat as the filmmakers had intended, but the fire quickly raged out of control and engulfed both ships.
The person killed was a 23-year-old stuntman, the Beijing News reported, citing a local fire commander.
Woo, told of the news while promoting his film in Hong Kong, rushed back to Beijing, the crew said.
They are making every effort to make arrangements for the deceased, his family and the injured crew members," the statement said.
It was the latest setback to Woo's massive production, which marks his return to Chinese-language film after a stint in Hollywood.

INNSBRUCK, Austria (CNN) Guus Hiddink is used to being the underdogs at major tournaments and is trying hard to make sure his Russia side are not seen as favorites for their opening European Championship match against Spain.
Having watched the Czech Republic, Portugal, Croatia and Germany win the first four games of the tournament, Hiddink, who took South Korea to the semifinals of the 2002 World Cup, is urging his latest side to buck the trend that seems to be developing.
"Favorites have won their first game in the tournament," Hiddink said Monday.
"So tomorrow in our confrontation with Spain and I have said it many times that they are favorite we hope to break the (pattern).
Victory over the Group D favorite at the Tivoli Neu stadium would not be the first time a team coached by Hiddink has caused an upset against Spain.
At the World Cup in 2002, his South Korea team beat Spain on penalties in the quarterfinal on its way to a fourth-place finish that shocked football.
But Hiddink said he would draw little from the match six years ago.
"We are on the eve of this tournament. It's different circumstances, different teams, different coaches, everything is different.
The 61-year-old Dutchman usually likes his teams to play attractive, attacking football, but he will likely have to temper that instinct against the potent Spanish midfield and attack, especially since Russia is missing its two best forwards, the injured Pavel Pogrebnyak and suspended Andrei Arshavin.
Hiddink did not give anything away about his tactics on Monday, but his captain Sergei Semak hinted that Russia would try to crowd the midfield to stifle the creativity of stars like Fernando Torres and David Villa, who have scored a combined 56 goals this season.
said Semak, who is the most experienced player with 46 international appearances.
CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) McDonald's, Wal-Mart and other U.S. chains have halted sales of some raw tomatoes as federal health officials work to trace the source of a multistate salmonella food poisoning outbreak.
Burger King, Outback Steakhouse and Taco Bell were among other restaurants voluntarily withdrawing tomatoes from their menus, following federal recommendations that consumers avoid red plum, red Roma or round red tomatoes unless they were grown in certain states and countries.
McDonald's Corp., the world's largest hamburger chain, stopped serving sliced tomatoes on its sandwiches as a precaution until the source of the bacterial infection is known, according to a statement Monday from spokeswoman Danya Proud.
The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company will continue serving grape tomatoes in its salads because no problems have been linked to that variety, she said.

SAQQARA, Egypt (CNN) Egyptian archaeologists have uncovered the "missing pyramid" of a pharaoh and a ceremonial procession road where high priests carried mummified remains of sacred bulls, Egypt's antiquities chief said Thursday.
Zahi Hawass said the pyramid, of which only the base remains, is believed to be that of King Menkauhor, an obscure pharaoh who ruled for only eight years more than 4,000 years ago.
In 1842, German archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius mentioned Menkauhor's pyramid among his finds at Saqqara, calling it the "Headless Pyramid" because its top was missing, Hawass said.
But the desert sands covered Lepsius' discovery, and no archaeologist since was able to find it.
of the missing pyramid," Hawass said on a tour of the discoveries at Saqqara, the necropolis and burial site of the rulers of ancient Memphis, the capital of Egypt's Old Kingdom, south of Cairo.
Only the pyramid's base or the superstructure, as archeologists call it was found after a 25-foot-high mound of sand was removed over the past year and a half by Hawass' team.
A burial chamber also was discovered.
Hawass said the style of the pyramid and of a gray granite sarcophagus lid found in the burial chamber indicates the pyramid was from the Fifth Dynasty, a period that began in 2465 B.C. and ended in 2325 B.C.
That would put it about two centuries after the completion of the Great Pyramid of Giza, believed to have been finished in 2500 B.C.
Archaeologists have not found a cartouche a pharoah's name in hieroglyphs of the pyramid's owner.
But Hawass said that, based on the estimated dating of the pyramid, he was convinced it belonged to Menkauhor.

And the manner of his comprehensive victory left little doubt that Federer, who has won 12 other Grand Slam titles, may struggle for many years to come in his bid to defeat his nemesis.
Second seed Nadal, who did not drop a set all tournament and has never lost at the clay-court event, matched the feat of Bjorn Borg's four successive wins from 1978-81.
He moved to a 28-0 winning record at the tournament, having won 84 of 92 sets played.
Nadal broke Federer in the opening game of the match, and needed only 32 minutes to wrap up the first set.
Federer fought back in the second, but still succumbed within 50 minutes, and then saw Nadal race through the third set in less than half an hour to clinch a historic victory.
Federer paid for his errors, having made 13 unforced mistakes to two by Nadal by the end of the second set.

LUCKNOW, India (CNN) He's a revered Hindu monkey god.
And now, he's the chairman of an Indian business school.
Hanuman, the popular god known for his strength and valor, has been named official chairman of the recently opened Sardar Bhagat Singh College of Technology and Management in northern India, a school official said Saturday.
The position comes with an incense-filled office, a desk and a laptop computer.
Four chairs will be placed facing the empty seat reserved for the chairman and all visitors must enter the office barefoot, said Vivek Kangdi, the school's vice chairman.
"It is our belief that any job that has the blessings of Lord Hanuman is bound to be a success," said Kangdi.
All Hindus know that Hanuman can lift mountains and leap oceans, but ancient texts make no mention of his business acumen.
"When we were looking for a chairman for our institution, we scanned many big names in the field of technology and management. Ultimately, we settled for Lord Hanuman, as none was bigger than him," Kangdi said.
Hanuman is one of the most popular gods in the crowded pantheon of Hindu deities.
His most famous feat, as described in the Hindu epic the Ramayana, was leading a monkey army to fight the demon King Ravana and rescue a kidnapped princess.
The Sardar Bhagat Singh College in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, awards bachelor's degrees in engineering and management.
The school opened last year.

Leftist rebels in Colombia should release all hostages in their custody as a first step toward laying down their weapons, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela said Sunday.
In pointed remarks, Chavez said the rebels should stop fighting and end a war that has riven Colombia for more than 40 years, killing tens of thousands.
His comments came just months after he urged the international community to recognize the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia as a legitimate insurgent force rather than a terrorist organization, as the United States and European Union consider it.
KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) &#8212; U.S. first lady Laura Bush arrived in Afghanistan Sunday for a visit that is expected to last nine hours.
The first lady is scheduled to meet with American troops and visit Bamiyan province, where two giant statues of Buddha &#8212; carved into sandstone cliffs centuries ago &#8212;
were demolished by the ruling Taliban regime in March 2001.
It is her third trip to the country.
She last visited Afghanistan in March 2006 with President Bush.
Later in the week, the first lady is scheduled to address a donors conference in Paris on Thursday.

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) &#8212; Eight former officials from executed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein¡¯s government will be transferred from U.S. military prisons to Iraqi custody in the coming days, Iraq¡¯s Deputy Justice Minister told CNN on Sunday.
Deputy Justice Minister Boshu Ibrahim said most of the prisoners were informed of the upcoming transfer by Iraq¡¯s acting justice minister last week and were ¡°very happy¡± to hear they will be in Iraqi custody soon.
But an attorney for some of the detainees expressed outrage about putting the mostly Sunni Muslim ex-officials in prisons controlled by the country¡¯s Shiite-dominated government.
¡°This is not a handover to a government, it¡¯s a handover to Iranian militias,¡± said Badi Aref, who represents 15 former regime members. ¡°We will hold the U.S. responsible for all that these detainees will go through.
The current Iraqi government is now dominated by Shiite and Kurdish politicians and has close ties to Iran, which fought a bloody eight-year war with Iraq under Hussein.

(CNN) Now that she has ended her historic run to become the first Madame President, many are speculating about what Sen. Hillary Clinton will do next.
On Saturday, she held her last rally, telling thousands of supporters she was endorsing her former rival, Sen. Barack Obama, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee Tuesday.
"The way to continue our fight now, to accomplish the goals for which we stand, is to take our energy, our passion, our strength, and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next president of the United States," she told the packed crowd at the National Building Museum in Washington.
campaign trail to stump for Obama.
Some of her top backers are hoping she will play a larger role in the Obama campaign by becoming his running mate.
Clinton told New York lawmakers this week that she'd be open to becoming the Democrat's vice presidential nominee, some of them said, but Obama has said only that Clinton "would be on anyone's short-list.
Democratic analyst Jamal Simmons says Clinton has reason to look beyond a joint ticket.
"Hillary Clinton may actually think she spent the last year, year-and-a-half getting out from the shadow of Bill Clinton. She may not want to get underneath the wing of Barack Obama," said Simmons, an Obama supporter.
Apart from the vice presidency, analysts say, there are several roles Clinton could potentially fill.
Some New York Democrats would love to see a Gov. Hillary Clinton in 2010.
But the primary fight would put her up against David Paterson, New York's first African-American governor.
Paterson took over after Eliot Spitzer stepped down in the wake of his call-girl scandal.
Clinton could potentially add Supreme Court justice to her r&eacute;
Should Obama become the president, he could carve out a place for Clinton in his Cabinet.
Based on Obama's own words, the idea might not be too far-fetched.
Some angry voters wonder whether she ought to dump the Democrats and run as an independent.
She did rack up more than 17 million votes in the primary.
Many analysts say the best option for Clinton is to return to the Senate, where she can establish a powerful influential voice like that of Sen. Edward Kennedy.
LONDON, England (CNN) London's Royal Botanical Gardens (RBG) at Kew recently opened a new attraction which gives visitors the chance to walk among the treetops and examine tree canopies from a new perspective.
The Xstrata Treetop Walkway, which opened at the end of May is the latest design from London Eye architects Marks Barfield.
Rising to a height of 18 meters and stretching across 200 meters, visitors can walk between 50 of Kew's mature broad-leafed trees.
The walkway can be found in the woodland area which was designed by 18th century landscape gardener Capability Brown.
Constructed from 12 steel trusses connected to 10 circular "node" platforms, the weathered steel chosen for the project already blends beautifully with the natural environment.
The architects describe the end result as "a surprisingly natural, 'bark-like' texture.
"As a trained arborist I have had the privilege of being up in the tree canopy; experiencing trees at height and birds and other wildlife from a completely different perspective. It's fantastic that we are able to give visitors the same experience.
In what has been designated "Year of the Tree" at Kew, Kirkham hopes that giving visitors a new perspective on the trees will help them understand the importance of nurturing them.
TOKYO, Japan (CNN) Police evacuated dozens of residents after poisonous fumes escaped from an apartment where a man killed himself by inhaling a detergent-laced gas, authorities said Wednesday.
The death in the city of Kanazawa, northeast of Tokyo, is the latest in a spate of suicides where people have mixed detergent and other chemicals and inhaled the resulting toxic hydrogen sulfide gas.
According to local media reports, more than 180 people across Japan have committed suicide in such a manner since late March an average of more than two a day.
The instructions are easily available online, and officials have asked Internet service providers to take down the recipe for the deadly mix.
In the latest case on Wednesday, officers found a man in his 20s in the bathroom of his apartment surrounded by bottles of detergent and other chemicals, said a Kanazawa police officer.
The man had posted a note outside his front door that warned residents that gas was being generated inside, the officer said.
Police evacuated 34 residents for two hours.
One woman, complaining of sickness, was taken to a hospital.
Even before the spate of recent death, Japan had one of the highest rates of suicide in the world.
A consumer advocacy group called on the Food and Drug Administration Tuesday to ban the use of eight artificial colorings in food because they have been linked to hyperactivity and behavior problems in children.
Controlled studies conducted over three decades have shown that children's behavior can be worsened by some artificial dyes, says the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
The group noted the British government is successfully pressuring food manufacturers to switch to safer colorings.
Over the years, the FDA has consistently disputed the center's assertion.
The agency's Web site contains a 2004 brochure that asks the question:
"Do additives cause childhood hyperactivity?
"No. Although this hypothesis was popularized in the 1970's, well-controlled studies conducted since then have produced no evidence that food additives cause hyperactivity or learning disabilities in children," the agency said.
Julie Zawisza, an FDA spokeswoman, said Tuesday that color additives undergo safety reviews prior to approval for marketing and that samples of each artificial coloring are tested.
"(We) didn't find a reason to change our conclusions that the ingredients are safe for the general population," Zawisza said. "Also note that the European Food Safety Agency has a similar view as FDA's.
Dyes are used in countless foods and are sometimes used to simulate the color of fruits or vegetables.
The additives are particularly prevalent in the cereals, candies, sodas, and snack foods pitched to children.
HARTFORD, Connecticut (CNN) Passing notes in study hall or getting your best friend to ask a boy if he likes you or, you know, LIKES you, is so last century.
Nowadays, teenagers are snapping naked pictures of themselves on their cell phones and sending them to their boyfriends and girlfriends.
Many of these pictures are falling into the wrong hands or worse, everyone's hands, via the Internet and leading to criminal charges.
Some parents are aghast.
"I just don't understand why kids would do a stupid thing like that," said Rochelle Hoins of Castle Rock, Colorado, where 18 students in her twin sons' middle school sent around nude pictures of themselves last year.
Similar cases have been reported in New Jersey, New York, Alabama, Utah, Pennsylvania, Texas and Connecticut.
"It used to be that kids would make mistakes, and it was local and singular and everyone knew it was part of growing up," said Catherine Davis, a PTA co-president in Westport, Connecticut, who had a frank talk with her two sons after several students' nude self-portraits recently spread through the wealthy New York City bedroom community.
"Now a stupid adolescent mistake can take on major implications and go on their record for the rest of their lives," she added.
School administrators in Santa Fe, Texas, confiscated dozens of cell phones from students in May after nude photos of two junior high girls began circulating.
The girls had sent the photos to their boyfriends, who forwarded them to others, officials said.
In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a 17-year-old boy recently was charged with child pornography, sexual exploitation of a child and defamation for allegedly posting nude photos of his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend on his MySpace page.
The girl had taken the pictures with her cell phone at her mother's home and e-mailed them to the boyfriend, authorities said.
He didn't know it was illegal. "
HONG KONG (CNN) The backlash in China against Sharon Stone continued Wednesday as the Shanghai International Film Festival said the American actress was not welcome at this year's event.
The 50-year-old "Basic Instinct" star provoked outrage in China after suggesting that the recent earthquake in central Sichuan province may have been the result of bad "karma" because of Beijing's rule in Tibet.
French fashion house Christian Dior dropped Stone from its Chinese ads after she made the comments in May during a Cannes Film Festival red-carpet interview.
Stone, who walked the red carpet in Shanghai last year, will not be invited back soon, Shanghai International Film Festival spokeswoman Tang Bing said Wednesday.
Tang said film festival organizers sent Stone a letter protesting her remarks and demanding an apology.
Stone has said she was "deeply sorry" for causing anguish and anger among Chinese people, and she offered to take part in quake relief efforts.
The Hollywood actress impressed festival organizers with her charity work and her appearance last year, and her comments came as a surprise, Tang said.
"She showed her affinity for the Chinese people and her affinity for Shanghai. She didn't say any bad things," said Tang.
The Shanghai festival is scheduled for June 14-22.
ROME, Italy (CNN) The Vatican announced Thursday in a general decree that it will excommunicate anyone who would attempt to ordain a woman as a priest and the woman herself.
According to the decree, the excommunications would take place with immediate effect.
The decree was signed by Cardinal William Levada, prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith.
It was not persuasive to Regina Nicolosi, a program coordinator for Roman Catholic Womenpriests, who was ordained two years ago.
"We have come not to take that too seriously," said Nicolosi, a 66-year-old married mother and grandmother who lives in Red Wing, Minnesota, and said her group is composed of 40 to 50 women priests, none of whom are recognized by the church hierarchy.
"It's one of the very last patriarchal hierarchies in the western world, and I don't know when they will be ready to let go of that.
Though she said she wants to reform the church from within, she will continue her work as a volunteer in a nursing home who celebrates mass in small groups even if she is excommunicated, she said.
She predicted that the church's resistance will backfire.
"This is bringing more and more women into our group, and I think we're getting more support from Catholics who are saying this is getting ridiculous," she said.
PARIS, France (CNN) A Paris court on Tuesday convicted Brigitte Bardot of provoking discrimination and racial hatred for writing that Muslims are destroying France.
The court also handed down a $23,325 fine against the former screen siren and animal rights campaigner.
The remarks were published in her foundation's quarterly journal.
In the December 2006 letter to Sarkozy, now the president, Bardot said France is "tired of being led by the nose by this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts.
She was referring to the Muslim feast of Aid el-Kebir, celebrated by slaughtering sheep.
French anti-racism laws prevent inciting hatred and discrimination on racial or religious or racial grounds.
Bardot had been convicted four times previously for inciting racial hatred.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama will be ¡°a good friend to Israel¡± if elected, Sen. Hillary Clinton told a pro-Israel lobbying group Wednesday.
Though Clinton has yet to concede the Democratic race and spoke Wednesday of what she would do as president, she told the America-Israel Public Affairs Committee that Obama ¡°understands what is at stake here.
¡°It has been an honor to contest these primaries with him.
It is an honor to call him my friend. And let me be very clear:
I know that Senator Obama will be a good friend to Israel,¡± the New York senator and former first lady said.

Caroline Kennedy has joined Barack Obama¡¯s vice presidential selection team, an Obama campaign spokesman said Wednesday.
Former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson is heading up the search team and former Deputy U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is also serving on the committee.
Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, formally endorsed Obama late January in a New York Times op-ed piece titled, ¡°A President Like My Father.
¡°I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them,¡± Kennedy wrote then. ¡°But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president &#8212; not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans.
NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) Kenyans have long watched the U.S. presidential election with special interest and, in many cases, a special sense of pride.
Barak Obama is the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas.
"I'm excited ... because he's a Kenyan. He's a half Kenyan," a smiling woman said in a Nairobi neighborhood.
More than a few hangovers were expected Wednesday as many Kenyans celebrated the presumptive Democratic nominee's latest primary election win and him surpassing the delegate total needed to win the party's nomination.
Video from across the country showed Kenyans dancing and swilling Senator Keg Lager, which has picked up the nickname "Obama Beer" in honor of the junior senator from Illinois.
Obama is popular across many parts of the country, especially in western Kenya where many of his relatives live.
"I want a black man to rule America so that you can see the changes that Obama promised the people ... to see the change," one young man said.
In summer 2006 thousands of Kenyans lined the streets of Kisumu, giving Obama a hero's welcome on his visit to his father's home.
Obama's father died in a car accident in Nairobi in 1982.
As he rode through the streets in a truck, flanked by a lengthy convoy, massive crowds chanted "Obama, Obama" and waved flags emblazoned with his name and an image of his face.
(CNN) A man and a woman have been charged by police in Italy after they were found having sex in a confession box, it was reported Wednesday.
The Italian ANSA news agency said the young man and woman were taken into custody by police in the northern city of Cesena following a telephone complaint from a man attending morning Mass in the city's cathedral.
Authorities were alerted after a parishoner heard "rustling and groaning" coming from inside the confession box and pulled back the curtains to reveal a goth-rock couple engaged in oral sex, ANSA said.
The agency said the pair a 31-year-old laborer and a 32-year-old teacher defended their conduct saying: "We are atheists and for us, having sex in church is like doing it any other place.
However, Bishop Antonio Lanfranchi of Cesena-Sarsina took said the couple's behavior was "an outrage of notable proportions which bespeaks unutterable squalor.
He added that a special ceremony would be held to purify the confession box.
HOUSTON, Texas (CNN) The international space station's toilet trouble appeared to be taken care of Wednesday after a Russian cosmonaut replaced a malfunctioning pump.
The space station's toilet broke two weeks ago.
The problem, confined to the urine side of the commode, forced the orbiting outpost's crew of an American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts to flush manually with extra water several times a day.
Space shuttle Discovery brought up a new pump for the toilet, as well as the space station's newest room, a $1 billion Japanese lab.
Oleg Kononenko spent more than two hours installing the 35-pound pump and hoses and then running three tests of the toilet while he talked with specialists at Russian Mission Control, just outside Moscow.
The toilet worked normally.
It transports urine via air flow to the pump, which separates the gas and liquid.
"Let's start using it," Russian Mission Control told Kononenko, one of the two Russians living aboard the space station. "We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Kononenko was asked to give periodic reports on how the toilet was working.
Sen. Barack Obama, the newly minted presumed Democratic presidential nominee, said Wednesday that it was "very humbling" to be the the first African-American to lead a major party's ticket and expressed confidence the party would unify behind him.
"You think about all the people who had to knock down barriers for me to walk through this door," he said.
"And the challenges they went through were so much more difficult, so much more severe, and the risks they took were so much greater that I will say, last night standing in that auditorium, it struck me that it was testimony to them.
The senator from Illinois also said his successful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination has taught America's children that the Oval Office is within anyone's reach.
"I have heard from a number of people already, both black and white, that their kids 7, 8, 9 years old take for granted now that, of course, a black can run for president, that a woman can run for president," he said. "There is a matter-of-factness to it that I think bodes well for the future."
Asked whether he was disappointed that his rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton, did not concede outright Tuesday night, Obama said his priority was unifying the party.
Clinton will officially end her campaign for the presidency by the end of the week, sources said.
A top Clinton fundraiser said her withdrawal is expected to happen Friday.
Obama won more than the 2,118 delegates needed to capture the nomination after the primaries in South Dakota and Montana on Tuesday.
The win came after five months of sometimes bitter contests with Clinton. He now has 2,158 delegates, according to CNN estimates.
On Wednesday, Obama's next challenger, Arizona Sen. John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee, congratulated Obama on his victory and immediately challenged him to 10 town hall meetings before the parties' conventions in late August and September.
BEIJING, China (CNN) Authorities in southwestern China watched nervously Wednesday as rising water behind an earthquake-created dam neared a spillway designed to relieve pressure on it.
The threat of aftershocks from the May 12 quake and more rain, meanwhile, put the area in "extreme danger," said Liu Ning, chief engineer of the Ministry of Water Resources.
Heavy rainfall and severe aftershocks could compromise the integrity of the dam and send water cascading out.
In the event of particularly heavy rain and a major aftershock, the chances of a catastrophic failure would stand at 93 percent, Liu estimated.
Authorities have evacuated about 200,000 people who are considered to be at risk if water overflows the dam.
Engineers built the spillway to drain water from the lake in a controlled way once it tops the lowest levels of debris blocking the river.
On Tuesday, water in the so-called Tangjiashan quake lake was within 8 feet (2.4 meters) of the spillway, in Beichuan county, Cheng Dianlong, deputy chief of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, told the Xinhua news agency.
Engineers used heavy equipment and dynamite to chisel a 1,560 foot-long (475-meter-long) spillway through tons of rock and soil that slid off the hillside during the earthquake.
They finished work on the channel Sunday.
Thirty-five so-called quake lakes were created by the 7.9-magnitude quake.
The Tangjiashan lake worries Chinese officials most because it could threaten up to 1.3 million people downstream.
The official death toll from the quake has risen to 69,107, China's Civil Affairs Ministry reported on Tuesday, an increase of 88.
About 18,230 people remain missing.
Sen. Hillary Clinton will officially end her campaign for the presidency by the end of the week, multiple sources told CNN.
A top Clinton fundraiser says it is expected to happen on Friday.
Obama and Clinton were in Washington on Wednesday to each address the influential American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
The candidates ran into each other at the AIPAC conference and had a brief chat, Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass said.
"She's an extraordinary leader of the Democratic Party and has made history alongside me over the last 16 months.
I'm very proud to have competed against her," Obama told the Israel lobbying group.
Obama became his party's presumptive nominee Tuesday and will be looking to unite Democrats divided by the long and contentious primary season.
"I am very confident how unified the Democratic Party is going to be to win in November," he said in a Senate hallway Wednesday.
Some say that putting Clinton on the ticket might fit the bill for uniting Democrats.
Clinton lavished her opponent with praise Tuesday, saying he ran an "extraordinary race" and made politics more palatable for many.
John McCain on Wednesday challenged Barack Obama to join him for a series of 10 town-hall debates.
Calling for ¡°no process questions from reporters¡± and ¡°no spin rooms,¡± the presumptive Republican presidential nominee proposed one debate a week from now until the Democratic party convention in August.
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe welcomed the idea in principle, but suggested some changes to the format. ¡°We would recommend a format that is less structured and lengthier than the McCain campaign suggests, one that more closely resembles the historic debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas,¡± he said in a statement released by the Obama campaign.
Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was released late Wednesday after being detained by police for about 10 hours, police and Tsvangirai¡¯s spokesman said.
Zimbabwe police detained Tsvangirai, the MDC¡¯s presidential contender, earlier Wednesday, less than a month before the run-off election against President Robert Mugabe, a police spokesman said.
Chamisa said Tsvangirai was picked up by police because he was going to attend an unauthorized meeting in southern Zimbabwe.

Thierry Henry collected his 100th cap for France in Tuesday's 1-0 win over Colombia, playing 76 minutes in Les Bleus' final warm-up game before the European Championship.
Henry was fouled to set up France's only goal, a 24th-minute penalty by Franck Ribery past goalkeeper Agustino Julio.
He also went close in the 42nd with a curling free kick that forced Julio into a leaping save, but was shown a yellow card in the 62nd for a late tackle.
Former Arsenal marksman Henry was replaced by Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka with 14 minutes remaining.

In what he called a "defining moment for our nation," Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday became the first African-American to head the ticket of a major political party.
"Tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another a journey that will bring a new and better day to America," he said.
"Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.
Obama's rally was at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota the same arena which will house the 2008 Republican National Convention in September.
Speaking in New York, Sen. Hillary Clinton, congratulated Obama for his campaign, but she did not concede the race nor discuss the possibility of running as vice president.
"This has been a long campaign, and I will be making no decisions tonight," she said.
There were reports earlier in the day that she would concede, but her campaign said she was "absolutely not" prepared to do so.
Two New York lawmakers also told CNN on Tuesday that during a conference call Clinton expressed willingness to serve as Obama's running mate in November.
One source told CNN that Clinton told those on the call that if asked by Obama, she would be interested in serving as his running mate.
One of the lawmakers said Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, has been pushing the idea privately for several weeks.
Clinton said she would meet with supporters and party leaders in the coming days to determine her next steps.
She also asked people to go to her Web site to "share your thoughts with me and help in any way that you can."
CNN has projected that Clinton will win the primary in South Dakota and Obama will take Montana.
Those states marked the final contests in the primary season.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice blasted Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas on Tuesday and called the United States' bond with Israel "unshakable.
In a speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, Rice said the United States' commitment to Israel was "unwavering."
Rice said President Bush had kept his promise to remain committed to Israel's security, and she characterized the alliance between the two nations as "one of the most vital relationships" the United States has.
"After 60 years, Israel has no better friend in the world than the United States of America.
She called for the return of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was captured by Gaza militants nearly two years ago in a cross-border raid.
Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said his Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist group has put forward a list of 350 Palestinians it wants released from Israeli jails in exchange for Shalit, but he blamed Israel for the breakdown of talks.
Rice said cooperation on missile defense with Israel would help the United States defend against Iran, along with going after Iranian agents in Iraq and continuing to impose sanctions on the regime.
In addressing perceived threats posed by Iran, Rice said that the United States is pursing tough diplomacy.
"We can and we must exploit these vulnerabilities.
MONTERREY, Mexico (CNN) A car plowed into a weekend bike race along a highway near the U.S.-Mexico border, killing one and injuring 10 others, police said.
The 28-year-old driver was apparently drunk and fell asleep when he crashed into the race, said police investigator Jose Alfredo Rodriguez.
A photograph taken by a city official showed bicyclists and equipment being hurled high into the air by the collision.
Rodriguez said Juan Campos was charged with killing Alejandro Alvarez, 37, of Monterrey.
Authorities said the wreck happened 15 minutes into the 34-kilometer (21 mile) race Sunday along a highway between Playa Bagdad and Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas.
Campos said he is an American citizen living in Brownsville
. The U.S. Consulate could not immediately confirm that.
"We are looking into the incident in terms of whether American citizens were involved," consulate spokesman Todd Huizinga said.
BERLIN, Germany (CNN) Three people are dead and many more injured after a major storm struck southwestern Germany, officials said Tuesday.
Two of those killed were women who drowned in their car after it was swept away by floodwaters, said Karl Wolf, a spokesman for the crisis management center in the Zollernalbkreis region in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
A third woman died when she became trapped in her flooded cellar.
Heavy rainfall set in late Monday, Wolf said, and caused the Starzel River to rise 6.5 feet (2 meters) above regular water levels, he said.
The region is about 35 miles south of Stuttgart.
Authorities said they cannot yet estimate how much damage the storm caused, but several roads need to be cleared and some bridges were damaged.
The police and fire department began clearing roads and pumping water out of cellars Tuesday.
It could take days before the situation normalizes, Wolf said.
Sen. Barack Obama has clinched the Democratic nomination for president, according to CNN estimates, making him the first African-American in U.S. history to lead a major-party ticket.
Obama picked up a slew of superdelegate endorsements on Tuesday.
Those endorsements, combined with the delegates he's projected to receive from South Dakota's primary, will put him past the 2,118 threshold, according to CNN estimates.
Obama will claim victory during a speech in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to prepared remarks released by his campaign.
"Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States," he's expected to say.
His remaining rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, does not plan to concede the race Tuesday night, campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe told CNN but one of her leading supporters said "a moment of truth" was at hand.
"I think a decision has to be made about whether keeping this nomination wide open is in the best interest of winning in November," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California.
"I do not believe that it is, and I'm a very strong supporter of Hillary being placed on ticket as a vice presidential candidate.
Two New York lawmakers told CNN on Tuesday that Clinton expressed willingness during a conference call to serve as Obama's running mate in November.
One of the lawmakers said Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, has been pushing the idea privately for several weeks.
Former President Jimmy Carter and Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House and the highest ranking African-American in Congress, were two of the most prominent superdelegate endorsements that Obama picked up.
He is redrawing an electoral map for Democrats.
Obama is looking more and more toward a likely general election matchup with John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.
Obama has started looking at Clinton as less of a rival and more as an important ally who can help him win in November.
"Sen. Clinton is an outstanding public servant, she has worked tirelessly on this campaign, she has been a great senator for the state of New York and she is going to be a great asset when we go into November to make sure that we defeat the Republicans," Obama said on the campaign trail Sunday in South Dakota, adding Monday in Michigan that "she and I will be working together."
General Motors Corp. will close four plants, a move that could cost the jobs of hundreds of employees, the company¡¯s chief executive officer said Tuesday.
This announcement comes after GM, the nation¡¯s largest automaker, posted a $3.3 billion net loss in the first quarter of this year.
The plants slated to end vehicle production are in Ohio, Wisconsin, Mexico and Canada, GM chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner said at a news conference

With seconds to spare, 4-year-old Shang Tian-Zhu bolted out of his school as it crumbled to the ground in last month¡¯s massive earthquake.
But the memories of the May 12 temblor still haunt the young boy.
¡°He cannot go above a first floor or near tall buildings,¡± his mother said. ¡°He wakes up most nights, yelling ¡®earthquake!
Holding tight to his mother, he returned to class for the first time Monday in a makeshift school under the cover of a donated tent.
Psychological counselors are also visiting the tent-schools to talk with the students about the tragedy.
WASHINGTON (CNN) Travelers from England, France, Germany, Japan and about two dozen other "Visa Waiver" countries will be required to register electronically before boarding a plane or boat to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday.
DHS will begin accepting applications via a secure Internet site on August 1, and will require visitors to use the Internet system beginning January 12, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said.
The move will help U.S. authorities vet foreign visitors, he said.
The announcement is the latest change to the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens of 27 countries most of them European countries that are strong U.S. allies to travel to the U.S. without a visa.
Currently, citizens from VWP countries complete a written form providing basic biographical, travel and eligibility information while en route to the U.S. and submit the forms to border officials on arrival.
Under the new program, known as Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, travelers will complete an electronic version of the form before traveling.
Initially, there will be no fee to apply for travel authorization, although one may be imposed later.
Visitors will still be required to have valid passports, but after January 12, travelers with valid ESTA clearance will not be required to complete the written form.
Chertoff said the system will make it easier for U.S. officials to check travelers against terror watch lists, and will help travelers by allowing them to deal with possible problems before they get to U.S. borders.
"a 21st century solution" to the problem of keeping terrorists out of the United States.
Critics, however, say the system does nothing to prevent "clean skin" terrorists those like shoe bomber Richard Reid who were not on terror watch lists from entering the United States.
Truckers and taxi drivers slowed traffic around Paris' business district to a crawl Tuesday in a protest over rising fuel prices, and hundreds of fishermen demonstrated in London to demand government help.
Dozens of trucks and taxis in Paris drove slowly toward and around the headquarters of oil giant Total in La Defense, site of the main financial district, to protest a new tax on heavily polluting vehicles.
Authorities said the operation snarled traffic on several highways.
Farmers elsewhere in France blocked ports and oil terminals as part of protests started by fishermen last month demanding government aid to help compensate for high fuel costs.
Fishermen from around the United Kingdom demonstrated in central London on Tuesday to demand their government's help in coping with soaring fuel prices.
Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organizations, said the cost of fuel for fishing boats was making it impossible for many in the industry to keep going.
"Boats are going out to sea and fish for five days in terrible conditions and we're not getting enough to even pay our crews," he said.
World oil prices have been climbing for months, and topped $135 a barrel on May 22.
They have since fallen slightly but remain at near-record levels.
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) An outbreak of salmonella food poisoning first linked to uncooked tomatoes has now been reported in nine states, U.S. health officials said Tuesday.
Lab tests have confirmed 40 illnesses in Texas and New Mexico as the same type of salmonella, right down to the genetic fingerprint.
An investigation by Texas and New Mexico health authorities and the Indian Health Service tied those cases to uncooked large tomatoes.
At least 17 people in Texas and New Mexico have been hospitalized.
None have died, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Thirty people have become sick with the same Salmonella Saintpaul infection in Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Idaho, Illinois and Indiana.
CDC investigators are looking into whether tomatoes were culprits there, too.
In Texas and New Mexico, raw large tomatoes including Roma and red round tomatoes were found to be a common factor in the 40 illnesses.
But no farm, distributor or grocery chain has been identified as the main source, said Casey Barton Behravesh, a CDC epidemiologist working on the investigation.
"The specific type and source of tomatoes is under investigation," she said.
Salmonella is a bacterial infection that lives in the intestinal tracts of humans and other animals.
The bacteria are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal feces.
Most infected people suffer fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps starting 12 to 72 hours after infection.
Many people recover without treatment. However, severe infection and even death are possible.
Infants, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk for severe infections.
By mid-afternoon in Europe, light, sweet crude for July delivery fell $1.40 to $126.36 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Monday, the contract rose 41 cents to settle at $127.76.
In London, Brent crude on the ICE Futures exchange fell 46 cents to $127.56 a barrel.
Oil prices have fallen back sharply over the last dozen days after climbing above $135 a barrel on May 22.
Prices edged higher on Monday on concerns about heating oil supplies and after an OPEC official said there is no need for the cartel to pump more oil.
"Typically a seesaw pattern is an indication that the market has peaked," said Victor Shum, an energy analyst with Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. "But some see this as an opportunity to buy.
On Tuesday, General Motors said it would close four truck and SUV plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico as surging fuel prices hasten a dramatic shift to smaller vehicles.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) Al Qaeda or one of its affiliates was probably behind an explosion outside the Danish embassy in Pakistan, Denmark's intelligence service said Tuesday.
The massive blast in the capital city of Islamabad killed at least six people, injured 24 others and damaged the embassy wall and a neighboring United Nations building.
It also left a 4-foot-deep crater in the road.
"It is ... the assessment that al Qaeda or an al Qaeda-related group is the possible perpetrator behind the attack," said Carsten Thomsen, spokesman for the Danish Security and Intelligence Service.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries, such as Pakistan, have been the scene of protests since Danish newspapers reprinted cartoons that Muslims say insult their prophet.
The Islamabad attack came six weeks after al Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a video message, called on Muslims to retaliate against Denmark for the caricatures.
"The assessment as of now which is not a final assessment is that it seems to be a terror-related attack using a car bomb," Thomsen said. "And that it is, all in all, likely that the Danish embassy has been the target of the attack, regardless of the fact that the embassy lies in close proximity to other foreign representations.
Thomsen said the Danish Security and Intelligence Service did not discount the possibility that the attack may have been the work of some other militant groups.
"We should note that some other militant Islamic groups in Pakistan also might have the intention and capacity to target Danish targets in Pakistan," he said.
Sen. Hillary Clinton on Tuesday told New York lawmakers she is open to being the running mate of Sen. Barack Obama, her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, two of the lawmakers told CNN.
Charles Rangel, a senior member of the New York Democratic delegation, also told CNN, "I have reason to believe she is open to the [vice president] slot.
One of the sources added that former President Clinton has been privately pushing for a couple of weeks for his wife to be No. 2 on the ticket.
On Monday night, a close friend and adviser of the former first lady told CNN Clinton will say tonight "that she will do whatever it takes" to put a Democrat in the White House. Obama insiders saw that as an indication she would accept an offer to be his running mate if asked.
"In her speech [Tuesday] night, she will convey the message that first and foremost she is committed to Democrats winning in November and will do whatever she's asked to do," the Clinton adviser said.
Even though she discussed being Obama's running mate, her campaign chairman earlier in the day said Clinton was "absolutely not" prepared to concede the race after the polls close tonight in Montana and South Dakota, the final two contests on the primary calendar.
Terry McAuliffe rejected as "100 percent" incorrect an Associated Press report that Clinton is preparing to acknowledge Obama has the delegates to win the nomination Tuesday night as the five-month Democratic primary process comes to a close.
Obama "doesn't have the numbers today, and until someone has the numbers the race goes on," McAuliffe told CNN.
Obama continued to inch closer to the nomination as superdelegate endorsements trickled in Tuesday afternoon.
Obama on Tuesday had 2,106 delegates, just 12 delegates shy of the 2,118 needed to clinch the nomination.
World champions Italy have called up Fiorentina defender Alessandro Gamberini to replace Cannavaro, with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon likely taking over as captain.
Cannavaro was on the ground for about 20 minutes receiving treatment before being carried off on a stretcher.
The 7,000 local fans in attendance gave Cannavaro long applause when he finally exited.
Cannavaro was first taken to a hospital in Moedling, then he was transferred to the larger Vienna Akh facility for further tests.
Italy play their first game of the tournament against the Netherlands next Monday.
Cannavaro was instrumental in Italy's run to the World Cup title two years ago, earning the Golden Ball award based on his efforts at the tournament in Germany.
BERLIN, Germany (CNN) Berlin's mayor has expressed concern at Madame Tussauds' plans to include Adolf Hitler among prominent Germans who will be immortalized in wax at its new museum, his spokesman said Monday.
Klaus Wowereit has written a letter to the wax museum's curators urging them to consider carefully whether to include the Nazi dictator and, if they still do, to be careful how they present him, spokesman Guenter Kolodziej said Monday.
"In the mayor's view, he should not be shown as a cult figure," Kolodziej said.
Madame Tussauds' Berlin museum is scheduled to open on July 9.
It will be located on the Unter den Linden boulevard, close to the German capital's landmark Brandenburg Gate.
Spokeswoman Katrin Srumsdorf said the museum planned to send Wowereit an official response on Tuesday.
She stressed that curators recognize Hitler needs to be treated with sensitivity.
Unlike in London, where he stands along with major world leaders, Hitler's likeness in Berlin will be hunched over a desk in a dimly lit bunker, she added.
"He will appear as an old, broken man, as he might have looked in the days just before he committed suicide," Srumsdorf said.
The Hitler statue will be the only one on display behind glass, which means visitors won't be able to have their pictures taken with it;
Madame Tussauds Berlin will feature many prominent Germans, including former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, current Chancellor Angela Merkel and scientist Albert Einstein who left Germany shortly before Hitler took power in 1933, never to return.
Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, one of Hillary Clinton's most ardent supporters, said Sunday it's time for Hillary Clinton to acknowledge she has lost her bid for the Democratic nomination.
Vilsack, who was briefly a presidential candidate himself last year, told the Associated Press it's "pretty clear that Senator Obama is going to be the nominee.
"After Tuesday's contests, she needs to acknowledge that he's going to be the nominee and quickly get behind him," Vilsack also said.
He endorsed Clinton shortly after and played a key role in the New York senator's unsuccessful Iowa campaign effort.
His comments came the same day the Clinton showed signs she plans to press on after Tuesday's contests &#8212;
continuing argue she has won the popular vote and that the party's superdelegates are able to switch their allegiances before the convention in August.
Nineteen U.S. troops were killed in Iraq in May, the fewest killed in any month since the war started.
The second-lowest month for American deaths was in February 2004, when 20 were killed.
May's toll was a significant decrease from April, when 50 were killed the highest monthly figure since September.
The U.S. military death toll spiked last year as the U.S. troop escalation, dubbed the "surge," was unfolding.
In 2007, there were 104 deaths in April, 126 in May and 101 in June.
Numbers began dropping when the "surge" strategy took hold and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr suspended the activities of his militia, the Mehdi Army.
There were 78 American deaths in July, 2007;
29 in February; and 38 in March. May's death numbers appeared to support Senate testimony last month from Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq.
Petraeus said recent operations in three Iraqi cities have "contributed significantly to the reduction in violence.
The month of June may not bring such optimistic news.
A suicide car bomb struck an Iraqi police checkpoint outside police headquarters in Mosul on Monday, killing nine people, including four police officers, and wounding 46 people, a Mosul police official said.
Eight of the wounded were police officers, the official said.
Mosul is about 260 miles (420 km) north of Baghdad.
CORRENS, France (CNN) Brangelina must be cocooning.
The paparazzi swarming France's Cote d'Azur can't find Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
Locals mutter or giggle about the invasion of Hollywood glam.
A flyover of their new home in a luxurious villa turned up no clues about a report they've added a set of twins which Pitt's manager says is "not true.
A handful of parked cars and two men were seen from up above one planted next to the chopper, another peering skyward through binoculars from an estate driveway.
Other than that, there was no sign of human life outdoors or in.
Several shutters were pulled on the main stone house.
The apparent calm did not stop the buzz.
"Entertainment Tonight" first reported on its Web site Friday that the actress had given birth in France.
Show host Mary Hart cited an unidentified source who claimed to be in the delivery room, saying the twins were born and that "yes, mother and babies are fine.
Pitt's manager, Cynthia Pett-Dante, told The Associated Press: "We have no comment except the story is not true," and several celebrity news outlets also reported the story was false.
Despite the denial, the Web site of Britain's Now magazine on Saturday cited "sources in France" saying Jolie's doctor had flown in from California, and that the couple named the twin girls Isla Marcheline and Amelie Jane Jolie-Pitt.
Jolie has said previously that her twins are due in August.
She and Pitt already have four children: 6-year-old Maddox, 4-year-old Pax and 3-year-old Zahara, who are adopted, and 2-year-old Shiloh.
If Dr. Robert Zubrin could take a trip to Mars, he would be sure to pack a bread maker in his suitcase.
Not just because bread is a pretty reliable expeditionary food, but because the act of cooking, according to Zubrin, seems to help people get along with each other, especially when they are in slightly dire, less than luxurious and more than stressful circumstances.
He has, after all, led almost a half-dozen mock Mars missions on barren Arctic ice fields and scorching Utah deserts with volunteer teams made up of students, scientists, journalists and anyone else willing to wear fake spacesuits and live in tiny tin-can-like habitation modules for days on end.
The simulated expeditions were made, in part, to research ways to live and work on the Red Planet.
what personality types might best be suited to make the 35 million-mile journey and who would be better off watching from Mission Control.
"Some of these crews have worked out very well," said Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, a 7,000-member multinational group determined to reach what it calls the New World. "Others were at each other's throats.
While it will probably take at least another 20 years before Zubrin or anyone else for that matter makes it to the Martian surface, NASA and other space agencies are already drawing up plans for a voyage that will present astronauts not only with physical but also psychological challenges never faced by humans before.
"When you go to Mars, all bets are off," said Dr. Nick Kanas, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied astronaut psychology. "We don't know what is going to happen.
CINCINNATI, Ohio (CNN) The man who designed the Pringles potato chip packaging system was so proud of his accomplishment that a portion of his ashes has been buried in one of the iconic cans.
Fredric J. Baur, of Cincinnati, died May 4 at Vitas Hospice in Cincinnati, his family said.
Baur's children said they honored his request to bury him in one of the cans by placing part of his cremated remains in a Pringles container in his grave in suburban Springfield Township.
The rest of his remains were placed in an urn buried along with the can, with some placed in another urn and given to a grandson, said Baur's daughter, Linda Baur of Diamondhead, Mississippi.
Baur requested the burial arrangement because he was proud of his design of the Pringles container, a son, Lawrence Baur of Stevensville, Michigan, said Monday.
Baur was an organic chemist and food storage technician who specialized in research and development and quality control for Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble Co.
Baur filed for a patent for the tubular Pringles container and for the method of packaging the curved, stacked chips in the container in 1966, and it was granted in 1970, P&G archivist Ed Rider
Baur retired from P&G in the early 1980s.
Oil dropped below $127 a barrel Monday in Asia on worries that prices are cutting into demand and as a probe into futures trading by a U.S. regulator continued to weigh on the market.
Jitters about record high fuel and energy prices particularly in the U.S., which has just started its summer driving season have helped to pull oil off the $135.09 a barrel trading record hit May 22.
Data from the U.S. Energy Department and Federal Highway Administration and several surveys in recent days suggest American consumers are driving less.
Additional selling pressure came with last week's announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about an investigation into possible price manipulation in oil futures markets.
The CFTC also announced new rules designed to increase transparency of U.S. and international energy futures markets.
"There are more concerns on the high pricing we have seen, that it will have a negative impact on demand, and the fact that the CFTC is expanding its investigation of manipulation in the oil markets," said Victor Shum, an energy analyst with Purvin & Gertz in Singapore.
Late afternoon in Singapore, light, sweet crude for July delivery was down 80 cents at $126.55 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

(CNN) __ If you're prepared to put in some elbow grease and be the envy of your working-stiff friends, consider these cool jobs:
1. Toy creator
Toy creators, also known as commercial and industrial designers, get the best of both worlds:
They use their imaginations and play with toys without the hassle of noisy customers.
They get paid to think of ideas for new toys, produce them and play with them to see if they're ready to go into production.
2. Food scientist
You might not have ever cared who creates all the different flavors of ice cream as long as the scoops keep appearing in your bowl.
Well, food scientists spend their days in laboratories developing and perfecting new flavors so that low-fat birthday cake ice cream tastes good and not, well, low-fat.
3. Doll fashion designer
Fashion designers, like the ones who create the clothes you're wearing right now, decide what attire dolls need and come up with the best design to sell to the public.
It might sound like child's play, but consider that Barbie's wardrobe makes Mattel one of the world's largest clothing manufacturers.
4. Sommelier
Fine diners know that the perfect meal isn't just about the entr&eacute;
it's also about the glass of wine that accompanies each course. Of course, if you're like many people, you don't know if a Riesling is the best match for fresh tilapia or if it's a faux pas that will send the chef into tears.
Sommeliers know everything about wines, from the vineyards they were pressed in to the best entr&eacute; es to pair them with.
5. Athletic trainer
Every sports team has an athletic trainer on hand to get athletes into shape and to prevent injuries.
They know what stretches and exercises they need to get ready for a big game and how to treat any injuries that do occur.
6. Event planner
Event planners are responsible for finding convention and meeting sites, orchestrating enrollment and registration, possibly making transportation arrangements for attendees and negotiating prices for venues and hotels.
What makes this job cool is that, although you work hard ironing out the many wrinkles that big events entail, you get to visit various sites and network with people of every imaginable industry, which means you're not stuck at a desk all day.
Hillary Clinton said she will take the race for the Democratic presidential nomination "a day at a time" and is reviewing all options as she moves forward in her campaign.
"People have been trying to get me out of this race since Iowa and my political obituary has yet to be written and we're going forward," she told reporters Sunday before leaving Puerto Rico, where she snared 68 percent of the vote to win the majority of the delegates in the Caribbean U.S. territory.
After Tuesday's primaries in Montana and South Dakota the party's last contests superdelegates will push either Clinton or Sen. Barack Obama to the 2,118 delegates needed to secure the party's nomination.
Barack Obama leads among superdelegates 321 to 291, according to a CNN tally.
But Clinton pointed out superdelegates are free to "change their minds" and she hopes they will evaluate her wins since February and the coalition of voters she's pulled together.
"This has been such an intense process, I don't think there has been a lot of time for reflection of the sort that I'm advocating, which is OK," she said aboard her campaign plane after leaving Puerto Rico.
Obama leads Clinton in overall delegates 2,070 to 1,915, according to CNN calculations.
Despite Clinton's assertion that neither she nor Obama will have the necessary 2,118 delegates after Tuesday's showdown, the Obama camp expressed confidence that its candidate will clinch the nomination.
"If not Tuesday, I think it will be fairly soon," Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs told ABC's "This Week" on Sunday. "We hope this week, absolutely.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) A massive blast targeting the Danish Embassy in Pakistan Monday killed at least six people and wounded as many as 18, authorities said.
Confusion lingered about the attack in the capital city of Islamabad and the number of casualties.
Police at the scene said a suicide car bomber pulled up next to the embassy at about 1 p.m. and detonated explosives.
But Senior Superintendent of Police Ahmad Latif told CNN that authorities could not immediately label it a suicide attack.
Likewise, a medical worker told CNN the explosion killed eight people, including a young child and at least one foreign national.
But Latif put the number of fatalities at six and said none of the dead were foreigners.
Among the wounded, he said, was a Brazilian citizen of Pakistani descent.
Authorities differed on the number of wounded as well, with figures ranging from five to 18.
No embassy official was seriously hurt, Latif said.
It is not uncommon for preliminary casualty figures to vary:
police cautioned that the numbers could rise.
"My immediate reaction is that you can only condemn this," said Stig Moeller. "It is terrible that terrorists do this.
They're destroying the Pakistanis' ability to connect with Denmark. It is completely unacceptable.
Most of the 17 Democratic senators who are uncommitted superdelegates will endorse Sen. Barack Obama for president this week, sources told CNN Monday.
The lawmakers will wait until after the South Dakota and Montana primaries Tuesday before announcing their support for Obama, two sources familiar with discussions between Obama supporters and these senators told CNN's Gloria Borger.
Obama supporters have been "pressing" for these superdelegates to endorse early this week, but according to one source, "the senators don't want to pound Hillary Clinton, and there is a sense she should be given a grace period.
A series of meetings on the topic have been facilitated at different times by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin.
Durbin and Daschle are Obama supporters, while Harkin is uncommitted.
Obama is now 46 delegates short of the 2,118 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, while Clinton needs 202.
Obama has the support of 331 superdelegates to Clinton's 292.
Superdelegates are party elected officials and activists who are free to vote for either candidate.
Following Sunday's Puerto Rico primary, Obama picked up two more superdelegate nods, and Clinton received one.
Jack Jordan, 37, will serve the probationary term in his home state of Maryland with a stipulation that he obtain outpatient psychiatric treatment, spokesperson Tracy Golden confirmed.

The U.N. Security Council on Monday gave U.S. and allied warships new power to pursue pirates into the waters off Somalia, an effort to combat a new spate of hijackings off the Horn of Africa.
The unanimous resolution calls on U.N. members to use ¡°all necessary means to repress acts of piracy and armed robbery,¡± and authorizes warships to chase pirates into Somali territorial waters if necessary.
Somalia¡¯s U.N.-backed transitional government has said it would welcome international assistance in battling the pirates.
A French-led squadron, which includes U.S. and German ships, is currently patrolling the Somali coast.
Still, three European freighters were hijacked last week in the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea off the Horn of Africa.
CNN has projected that Hillary Clinton will win big in Puerto Rico.
Two of the key reasons are her strong performance among those voters who favor statehood for Puerto Rico and her husband's popularity on the island.
According to CNN's exit polls, 60 percent of Puerto Ricans who participated in the primary favor statehood, and Clinton won 82 percent of those voters.
Bill Clinton's overwhelming popularity in Puerto Rico also gave the New York senator a boost.
Just over 80 percent said they had a favorable view of the former president, and those voters went for Clinton by a 56 point margin, 78 percent to 22 percent.
(Among the 15 percent who hold an unfavorable opinion of Bill Clinton, 76 percent voted for Obama.)
(CNN) Myanmar's defense minister said Sunday his government broadcast warnings before a deadly cyclone hit the country last month and it has acted promptly since then in providing relief.
Major General Aye Mint told an international security conference in Singapore that military rulers broadcast warnings more than a week before Cyclone Nargis made landfall on May 2.
"The government warned the general public about the cyclone and storm through newspapers, radio and television since 24th of April," he said.
The minister once again reiterated Myanmar's position that the relief phase of the disaster is already over and the country has entered the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase.
Donor nations have insisted that immediate relief needs have yet to be met, with the United Nations saying it will take at least another six months.
search and rescue task, we are now emphasizing on the second phase," Mint said. "Works in this phase include rebuilding homes and reconstruction of the villages for local people hit by the storm.
About 130,000 people either died or are still missing since the cyclone struck.
Myanmar's government has put the death toll at 78,000.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon guided a conference of 52 donor nations in Myanmar on May 25.
At the meeting, countries pledged in excess of $100 million to help Myanmar recover and said they are willing to open up their wallets further once aid groups are granted access to the worst-affected areas.
Israel has approved the construction of almost 900 new homes in East Jerusalem, a move that could hinder international efforts to secure a peace deal by year's end.
The Palestinians hope to make East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state.
A spokesman for Israeli Housing Minister Zeev Boim said his office will issue a tender this week for the construction of 884 houses, 121 of them in Har Homa.
Israel and the Palestinians are in peace talks that include the future of Jewish settlements and East Jerusalem.
In March, Israel announced plans to build 600 homes in East Jerusalem as part of the Jerusalem mayor's initiative to construct 40,000 homes in the city to ease the housing plight of young couples.
At the time, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who was in the region to shore up support for the peace initiative said Israel should stop all settlement activity.
Largely at the request of the United States, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert froze construction in both Har Homa and Pisgat Zeev, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally and one of the first countries to commit troops to the war in Iraq five years ago, ended combat operations there Sunday.
Soldiers lowered the Australian flag that had flown over Camp Terendak in the southern Iraqi city of Talil.
The combat troops were expected to return to Australia over the next few weeks, with the first of them arriving home Sunday.
The move fulfills a campaign promise by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who was swept into office in November largely on the promise that he would bring home the country's 550 combat troops by the middle of 2008.
Rudd has said the Iraq deployment made Australia more of a target for terrorism.
Rudd's predecessor, former Prime Minister John Howard, said he was "baffled" by the decision to withdraw the troops.
Howard, who led the country for 11 years and celebrated his friendship with President Bush, told the newspaper that the decision to send Australian troops to Iraq in 2003 was "very, very , very hard."
But he stood by his choice, which he said helped further deepen Australia's alliance with the United States.
Australian troops helped train 33,000 Iraqi army soldiers following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.
They helped train the Iraqis in logistics management, combat service support and counterinsurgency operations.
BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) Thailand's prime minister has warned he may send in police and soldiers to disperse several hundred people who have been staging an around-the-clock protest in Bangkok for the past six days.
The Peoples Alliance for Democracy(PAD) is protesting proposed changed to Thailand's constitution which would protect former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his followers from corruption charges.
Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej issued his warning on government television Saturday, saying the protest must stop immediately and calling it a "make or break point.
PAD officials have rejected the warning and vowed to continue their demonstration which has not stopped since it began last Sunday.
It was a series of rallies by PAD in 2006 that led up to a military coup that toppled Prime Minister Thaksin, a wealthy telecommunications tycoon who now lives in exile.
Thaksin's party, the People Power Party(PPP), is the largest member of the current coalition government.
(CNN) A magnitude-6.4 earthquake hit the Pacific Ocean off the northern Philippines Sunday morning and was felt as far as southeastern Taiwan, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
The epicenter was about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Basco, the capital of the Batan Islands in the Philippines and about 340 miles (550 kilometers) south of Taipei, Taiwan.
No injuries, deaths or damage were immediately reported, said Manny Torres of the National Disaster Coordinating Center in Manila, Philippines.
The center put the earthquake at a 6.3 magnitude.
Sen. Hillary Clinton claimed victory in Puerto Rico on Sunday and insisted that she is leading Sen. Barack Obama in the popular vote.
With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton was ahead of Barack Obama by more than a 2-1 ratio.
Her win gives her the larger share of Puerto Rico's 55 delegates.
The Democratic primary season ends Tuesday when Montana and South Dakota cast their votes.
"When the voting concludes on Tuesday, neither Sen. Obama nor I will have the number of delegates to be the nominee," she said in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Obama leads in the overall delegate count 2,070 to Clinton's 1,915.
A candidate needs 2,118 to claim the Democratic nomination.
The Clinton campaign has been focusing on the popular vote as it tries to convince superdelegates to pick her instead of Obama.
The superdelegates are a group of about 800 party leaders and officials who vote at the convention for the candidate of their choice.
Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed confidence that Obama would clinch the nomination in the coming days.
"If not Tuesday, I think it will be fairly soon," he said Sunday on ABC's "This Week.
"We hope this week, absolutely," he added.
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) Massage, that art of laying on hands, has been around for a while and has seen some changes through the years.
Gone is the simple back rub with some oil tossed in.
Today's list of massage options is long and varied, a veritable smorgasbord of touchy-feely options.
But no matter the variation, most experts agree that massage is a good thing.
"It increases blood flow to muscles, and that increases healing and speeds healing time," said professor Allan Platt, who teaches physician assistants at Emory University's School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. "It's also good for obtaining the relaxation affect for the entire body, which lowers blood pressure, lowers the heart rate and decreases stress, which is all good.
But there are times when massage is not the answer. Platt gives examples:
"If there's any damage to bones or muscles that could be manipulated out of place," massage isn't a good idea, he cautioned. "Like a slipped disc or things like that, where it actually may increase irritation of the nerves or the nerve roots. Those are times where it may be beneficial to stay away or stay away from that area.
Other factors also might make avoiding that area a good idea.
"Rashes stay away from those areas that might be infected," warned Martha Young, a certified massage therapist. "Whether it's eczema, poison ivy or some other skin allergy, massaging that area might irritate it further.
She suggests clearing the therapy with a doctor, even before heading out for that massage.
She has massaged patients with rashes and just avoids those areas so it isn't a complete deal-breaker.
But some things are deal breakers.
Patients with high blood pressure who are not on medication should rethink this hands-on therapy method.
"Because getting a massage will increase your blood flow," Young explained, "that increase in a patient with already high blood pressure could cause problems.
And cancer patients should be especially cautious.
The lymphatic system is a key vehicle for the spread of cancer.
Massage that stimulates those glands could be detrimental, Young says.
The best rule of thumb is to check with your doctor if you have any major medical issues before you lie on that heated-up and padded-down massage table.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Sunday he will make a decision within "a matter of days" to withdraw U.S. Navy ships from the coast of Myanmar, because "it's becoming pretty clear the regime is not going to let us help.
As a result, he said many more people will die, particularly those in areas that can only be reached by helicopters, such as those sitting idle on the U.S. ships.
Speaking to reporters at the close of an international security conference here, Gates said the Myanmar representative at the forum did not seem interested in speaking with him.
But he said "it was interesting to watch as minister after minister described their respective unhappiness at their inability to get assistance in to Burma.
It was particularly pointed, he said, because Chinese officials thanked other countries for the help provided after the earthquake in China.
Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that even when the decision is made to pull the four U.S. Navy ships off the coast, the vessels will move away slowly enough to turn back if there is an unexpected change of heart by the Myanmar government.
Gates' comments came a day after he made his strongest public condemnation of the Myanmar government at the conference, saying that Myanmar's rulers "have kept their hands in their pockets" while other countries sought to help cyclone victims.
Legendary designer Yves Saint Laurent, who reworked the rules of fashion by creating elegant pantsuits that came to define how modern women dressed, died Sunday evening, a longtime friend and associate said.
Pierre Berge did not give details but said Saint Laurent had died following a long illness.
A towering figure of 20th century fashion, Saint Laurent was widely considered the last of a generation that included Christian Dior and Coco Chanel and made Paris the fashion capital of the world.
From the first YSL tuxedo and his trim pantsuits to see-through blouses, safari jackets and glamorous gowns, Saint Laurent created instant classics that remain stylish decades later.
When the designer announced his retirement in 2002 at age 65 and the closure of the Paris-based haute couture house he had founded 40 years earlier, it was mourned in the fashion world as the end of an era.
BEICHUAN COUNTY, China (CNN) Chinese soldiers and engineers have completed a spillway from an earthquake-created lake that was threatening to burst its banks in the central county of Beichuan, state-run news agency Xinhua reported Sunday.
Tangjiashan Lake was created when a landslide caused by the earthquake dammed Jianjiang River, threatening quake-hit communities downstream.
Authorities were concerned that the lake could burst its banks or that another aftershock or earthquake could rupture the earthen dam and cause a sudden flood of water on the communities downstream.
Workers hope the spillway will allow the water to bypass Beichuan town.
Farther downriver, in the town of Mianyang, Communist Party chief Tan Li head of the city's quake control and relief efforts renewed an order that 1.3 million people living downstream from Tangjiashan Lake be evacuated to higher ground.
The diversion project, which included a 475-meter (517-yard) channel up to 10 meters (33 feet) wide, was completed at 10 p.m. (10 a.m. ET) Saturday, said Liu Ning, chief engineer of the Ministry of Water Resources and the project's deputy director, Xinhua reported.
By Saturday night, about 135,500 cubic meters of mud and rocks had been removed from the lake, and the plan to use explosives to blow away the blockage was abandoned because of the channel's completion, Xinhua cited Liu as saying.
According to the plan, the lake which has been rising about 1.6 meters daily and was seven meters from the top of its naturally-formed dam would spill into its man-made canal between now and Thursday.
The lake in Beichuan County is the largest of several "quake lakes" created by the earthquake nearly three weeks ago.
The project to divert the water took nearly a week.
It will be Wednesday or Thursday before authorities know whether their emergency operation is successful, a commander said.
Because the region is so remote most of the roads were cut off by landslides the government has brought the equipment and personnel in with Russian military helicopters.
Another challenge is the weather.
The commander said some members of the Chinese army have resorted to walking to the site, carrying fuel on their backs, because the helicopters were unable to fly in the fog and rain.
Many of those who have already left have been living in tents after losing their homes in the earthquake, forcing them to pick up and move again some for the third time.
The government told frustrated evacuees that they were creating a safer place for them to stay.
However, the residents said the government-created site is not as desirable as the site they are being ordered to leave. They say they would like to return once floodwaters recede.
After a day of wrangling in front of a sometimes unruly crowd, the Democratic National Committee's rules and bylaws committee reinstated all of Florida and Michigan's delegates to its party convention, with each getting a half-vote to penalize the states for moving their primaries earlier than the party had approved.
The move will leave front-runner Sen. Barack Obama's lead over rival Sen. Hillary Clinton intact.
"This results in Sen. Clinton obtaining a substantial number of additional pledged delegates, but I also understand that many members of the Florida and Michigan delegations feel satisfied that the decision was fair," Obama said after a campaign event in Aberdeen, South Dakota.
"Our main goal is to get this resolved so we can immediately turn the focus of the entire party on winning Florida and Michigan and delivering on the needs of the people in Florida and Michigan states that are enormously important, states where a lot of people are struggling.
The Florida decision, which follows the pro-Clinton results of that state's primary, was greeted by virtually all sides as an acceptable compromise on a thorny issue.
But Clinton backers vowed to fight the Michigan decision, which gave the New York senator a 10-delegate edge over Obama in a state where his name didn't appear on the primary ballot.
With no Michigan or Florida delegates included, Obama led Clinton by 202 delegates.
The committee's ruling gave Clinton 105 pledged delegates from Florida and 69 from Michigan, with a total of 87 votes.
Obama received 67 pledged delegates from Florida and 59 from Michigan, casting a total of 63 votes.
That tally leaves Obama ahead by the equivalent of 174 delegates.
Sen. Hillary Clinton will win Puerto Rico's Democratic primary by a wide margin, CNN projects, giving her the larger share of the territory's 55 delegates.
Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe said Puerto Rico was "another great win" for the New York senator.
Clinton swept Obama in every major demographic group, including groups Obama generally wins, such as younger voters and higher income voters, according to CNN's exit polls.
The primary season ends Tuesday when voters in Montana and South Dakota weigh in in the lengthy nomination battle.
Those states have a combined 31 delegates up for grabs.
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) A pressurized cylinder exploded at Universal Studios on Sunday, injuring two firefighters as they tried to fight a blaze that began early in the day, Los Angeles authorities said.
The blaze at the studios' back lot destroyed several movie sets and the "King Kong" exhibit, and damaged a video vault.
Several firefighters suffered minor injuries, fire officials said.
No other injuries were reported, and the blaze is reportedly contained.
The fire destroyed an area called New York Street, which includes movie set-style buildings designed to look like the cityscape of New York City.
Between 40,000 and 50,000 videos and reels in vaults were damaged, said Ron Meyer, chief operating officer of Universal Studios, The Associated Press reported.
"The video library was affected and damaged, but our main vault of our motion picture negatives was not.
Hours after the morning blaze was reported, the roughly two-block area north of Los Angeles appeared charred and resembled a "disaster movie," Los Angeles City Councilman Tom LaBonge said.
He said he could see the smoke from his Silver Lake home Sunday morning. "It looked like a bomb had exploded," he said.
45 a.m. ET) and was contained by 9 a.m.
The set of "The Changeling," a film recently directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Angelina Jolie, was "completely destroyed," Meyer said.
Another area, called "Courthouse Square," also was destroyed, Meyer said.
Numerous movies have been shot in that area, including several scenes of the 1985 hit "Back to the Future," Meyer said.
And two of the eight locations used by the CBS series "Ghost Whisperer" were affected, he said.
A tour of the back lot area was closed Sunday but was expected to reopen Monday, park officials said.
Fire inspectors had not determined what caused the blaze, said Los Angles County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman.
There were no reports of filming at the time of the fire.
Jamaica's Usain Bolt is officially the fastest man on the planet as he set a new 100 meters world record of 9.72 seconds at an international meeting in New York.
Bolt was trimming two hundredths of a second off the record previously held by fellow-Jamaican Asafa Powell and for good measure relegated world champion Tyson Gay to a distant second.
Bolt gave credit to a big contingent of Jamaicans who were in the crowd to watch his feat.
"I just wanted to give them what they wanted.
"He ran a perfect race," Gay said. "I've got to take my hat off to him. "
The lanky 1.95 meter Bolt had produced his previous best performances before this year over 200 meters and finished second to Gay at this distance in last year's world championships.
But the record changes all that and with Powell, who is recovering from a chest injury, and Gay he will be among the favorites for the 100 meters at the Beijing Olympics.
Seven people died and more than 80 were injured Friday when a commercial airliner overshot the runway and traveled into an adjoining street, where it crushed three vehicles and cracked into three sections before coming to a halt a few feet from a house, officials said.
124 passengers, two pilots, four flight attendants and five crew members who were being repositioned &#8212; when it started the day in San Salvador.
The Airbus A-320 landed at Toncontin International Airport amid high winds and low visibility at at 9:45 a.m. (11: 45 a.m. ET), a Taca spokeswoman said.
(CNN) &#8211; Governments need to ban all tobacco advertising and promotions to deter adolescents from smoking, the World Health Organization said Friday.
The campaign is geared toward young people and the effects of advertising on tobacco use, citing statistics that show most smokers start before 18 years old, some reported as young as 10 years old.
¡°The tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug,¡± said Douglas Bettcher, director of the agency¡¯s Tobacco Free Initiative.
He said that¡¯s why the United Nations-backed organization is urging governments to ban all tobacco advertising, because ¡°when one form of advertising is banned, the tobacco industry simply shifts its vast resources to another channel,¡± including movies, magazines, sports venues and music.
The more they are exposed to tobacco advertising, the more likely young people will try smoking, according to the WHO based on recent studies.
The latest updated report on tobacco treatment from the United States Department of Health and Human Services says that tobacco kills more than 435,000 people in the United States each year, the equivalent of almost 1 of every 5 people in the country. About 1,200 adolescents and children daily become cigarette smokers, according to the report.

Denmark held the Netherlands to a 1-1 friendly draw in Eindhoven on Thursday, Marco van Basten's side's penultimate warm-up match for Euro 2008.
Ruud van Nistelrooy opened the scoring for the Dutch after 28 minutes but, with the home side squandering a host of chances, Christian Poulsen levelled 10 minutes after the break.
Coach van Basten made four changes to the side that beat Ukraine 3-0 at the weekend, with the inclusion of Arjen Robben and Van Nistelrooy the most decisive.
Van Basten announced this week that the Real Madrid striker would be his undisputed first choice striker and after 28 minutes Van Nistelrooy put the Dutch ahead after a fluent combination between Wesley Sneijder and Robben.
Robben, who only played half of the 12
qualifiers due to injuries, was in fine form and looks a certain starter in next month's tournament as one of the three attacking midfielders.
However, in defense, the Dutch looked shaky and an error from Joris Mathijsen allowed Nicklas Bendtner to control the ball in the area and set up Poulsen for the equaliser.
The Dutch have one more warm up against Wales in Rotterdam on Sunday before starting their Euro campaign against world champions Italy on June 9, with France and Romania as their other opponents in Group C.
Meanwhile, Turkey continued their preparations for the Euro 2008 finals with a 2-0 victory over Finland in Duisburg, Germany.
NEW DELHI, India (CNN) Members of an Indian ethnic community burned effigies, squatted on railroad tracks and blocked highways Thursday in an attempt to bring part of the country to a halt in a protest over caste classification.
The Gujjar community part of India's centuries-old, complex social caste order are in their seventh straight day of demonstrations to demand a bigger share of government jobs and education benefits.
Several days of clashes between Gujjars and police have left at least 35 people dead.
On Thursday, more than 35,000 police officers fanned out across the capital city of New Delhi and surrounding areas to maintain peace during the 'bandh,' or shutdown.
By 1 p.m., major arteries joining Delhi to surrounding cities had reopened.
In the Gujjar's home state of Rajasthan where
